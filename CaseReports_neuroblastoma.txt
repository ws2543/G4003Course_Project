Daratumumab, a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, is used to treat
multiple myeloma. We describe successful treatment with daratumumab in a case of 
treatment-refractory pure red-cell aplasia after ABO-mismatched allogeneic
stem-cell transplantation. The patient was a 72-year-old man with the
myelodysplastic syndrome who received a transplant from an HLA-matched, unrelated
donor with a major ABO incompatibility (blood group A in the donor and blood
group O in the recipient). The patient had persistent circulating anti-A
antibodies and no red-cell recovery 200 days after transplantation. Standard
treatments had no effect. Within 1 week after the initiation of treatment with
daratumumab, he no longer required transfusions.

JC virus, the cause of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and the 
BK virus are genetically similar and share sequence homology in immunogenic
proteins. We treated three immunosuppressed patients with PML with ex
vivo-expanded, partially HLA-matched, third-party-produced, cryopreserved BK
virus-specific T cells. The immunosuppression in these patients was due to the
conditioning regimen for cord-blood transplantation in one patient, a
myeloproliferative neoplasm treated with ruxolitinib in another, and acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome in the third. After T-cell infusion in two of the
patients, alleviation of the clinical signs and imaging features of PML was seen 
and JC virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cleared. The other patient had a
reduction in JC viral load and stabilization of symptoms that persisted until her
death 8 months after the first infusion. Two of the patients had immune
reconstitution syndrome. Donor-derived T cells were detected in the CSF after
infusion. (Funded by the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Moon Shots Program and the

The causes of ovarian dysgenesis remain incompletely understood. Two sisters with
XX ovarian dysgenesis carried compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the
BRCA2 gene that led to reduced BRCA2 protein levels and an impaired response to
DNA damage, which resulted in chromosomal breakage and the failure of RAD51 to be
recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks. The sisters also had microcephaly, and
one sister was in long-term remission from leukemia, which had been diagnosed
when she was 5 years old. Drosophila mutants that were null for an orthologue of 
BRCA2 were sterile, and gonadal dysgenesis was present in both sexes. These
results revealed a new role for BRCA2 and highlight the importance to ovarian
development of genes that are critical for recombination during meiosis. (Funded

Genetic deficiency of ectodysplasin A (EDA) causes X-linked hypohidrotic
ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED), in which the development of sweat glands is
irreversibly impaired, an condition that can lead to life-threatening
hyperthermia. We observed normal development of mouse fetuses with Eda mutations 
after they had been exposed in utero to a recombinant protein that includes the
receptor-binding domain of EDA. We administered this protein intraamniotically to
two affected human twins at gestational weeks 26 and 31 and to a single affected 
human fetus at gestational week 26; the infants, born in week 33 (twins) and week
39 (singleton), were able to sweat normally, and XLHED-related illness had not
developed by 14 to 22 months of age. (Funded by Edimer Pharmaceuticals and

BACKGROUND: Recent advances have enabled noninvasive mapping of cardiac
arrhythmias with electrocardiographic imaging and noninvasive delivery of precise
ablative radiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We combined
these techniques to perform catheter-free, electrophysiology-guided, noninvasive 
cardiac radioablation for ventricular tachycardia.
METHODS: We targeted arrhythmogenic scar regions by combining anatomical imaging 
with noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging during ventricular tachycardia that
was induced by means of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). SBRT
simulation, planning, and treatments were performed with the use of standard
techniques. Patients were treated with a single fraction of 25 Gy while awake.
Efficacy was assessed by counting episodes of ventricular tachycardia, as
recorded by ICDs. Safety was assessed by means of serial cardiac and thoracic
imaging.
RESULTS: From April through November 2015, five patients with high-risk,
refractory ventricular tachycardia underwent treatment. The mean noninvasive
ablation time was 14 minutes (range, 11 to 18). During the 3 months before
treatment, the patients had a combined history of 6577 episodes of ventricular
tachycardia. During a 6-week postablation "blanking period" (when arrhythmias may
occur owing to postablation inflammation), there were 680 episodes of ventricular
tachycardia. After the 6-week blanking period, there were 4 episodes of
ventricular tachycardia over the next 46 patient-months, for a reduction from
baseline of 99.9%. A reduction in episodes of ventricular tachycardia occurred in
all five patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction did not decrease
with treatment. At 3 months, adjacent lung showed opacities consistent with mild 
inflammatory changes, which had resolved by 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: In five patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia,
noninvasive treatment with electrophysiology-guided cardiac radioablation
markedly reduced the burden of ventricular tachycardia. (Funded by Barnes-Jewish 
Hospital Foundation and others.).

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widely distributed, viral, tickborne 
disease. In Europe, cases have been reported only in the southeastern part of the
continent. We report two autochthonous cases in Spain. The index patient acquired
the disease through a tick bite in the province of Ávila - 300 km away from the
province of Cáceres, where viral RNA from ticks was amplified in 2010. The second
patient was a nurse who became infected while caring for the index patient. Both 
were infected with the African 3 lineage of this virus. (Funded by Red de

A patient with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (LAD1) had severe
periodontitis and an intractable, deep, nonhealing sacral wound. We had
previously found a dominant interleukin-23-interleukin-17 signature at inflamed
sites in humans with LAD1 and in mouse models of the disorder. Blockade of this
pathway in mouse models has resulted in resolution of the immunopathologic
condition. We treated our patient with ustekinumab, an antibody that binds the
p40 subunit of interleukin-23 and interleukin-12 and thereby blocks the activity 
of these cytokines, inhibiting interleukin-23-dependent production of
interleukin-17. After 1 year of therapy, our patient had resolution of his
inflammatory lesions without serious infections or adverse reactions. Inhibition 
of interleukin-23 and interleukin-17 may have a role in the management of LAD1.

Adipose tissue-derived "stem cells" have been increasingly used by "stem-cell
clinics" in the United States and elsewhere to treat a variety of disorders. We
evaluated three patients in whom severe bilateral visual loss developed after
they received intravitreal injections of autologous adipose tissue-derived "stem 
cells" at one such clinic in the United States. In these three patients, the last
documented visual acuity on the Snellen eye chart before the injection ranged
from 20/30 to 20/200. The patients' severe visual loss after the injection was
associated with ocular hypertension, hemorrhagic retinopathy, vitreous
hemorrhage, combined traction and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, or lens
dislocation. After 1 year, the patients' visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to no
light perception.

We assessed the feasibility of transplanting a sheet of retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE) cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
in a patient with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The iPSCs were
generated from skin fibroblasts obtained from two patients with advanced
neovascular age-related macular degeneration and were differentiated into RPE
cells. The RPE cells and the iPSCs from which they were derived were subject to
extensive testing. A surgery that included the removal of the neovascular
membrane and transplantation of the autologous iPSC-derived RPE cell sheet under 
the retina was performed in one of the patients. At 1 year after surgery, the
transplanted sheet remained intact, best corrected visual acuity had not improved
or worsened, and cystoid macular edema was present. (Funded by Highway Program

Sickle cell disease results from a homozygous missense mutation in the β-globin
gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin S. Gene therapy for patients with
this disorder is complicated by the complex cellular abnormalities and challenges
in achieving effective, persistent inhibition of polymerization of hemoglobin S. 
We describe our first patient treated with lentiviral vector-mediated addition of
an antisickling β-globin gene into autologous hematopoietic stem cells. Adverse
events were consistent with busulfan conditioning. Fifteen months after
treatment, the level of therapeutic antisickling β-globin remained high
(approximately 50% of β-like-globin chains) without recurrence of sickle crises
and with correction of the biologic hallmarks of the disease. (Funded by Bluebird

A patient with recurrent multifocal glioblastoma received chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigen
interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2). Multiple infusions of CAR T cells were
administered over 220 days through two intracranial delivery routes - infusions
into the resected tumor cavity followed by infusions into the ventricular system.
Intracranial infusions of IL13Rα2-targeted CAR T cells were not associated with
any toxic effects of grade 3 or higher. After CAR T-cell treatment, regression of
all intracranial and spinal tumors was observed, along with corresponding
increases in levels of cytokines and immune cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.
This clinical response continued for 7.5 months after the initiation of CAR
T-cell therapy. (Funded by Gateway for Cancer Research and others;

BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is characterized by arrested 
T-lymphocyte production and by B-lymphocyte dysfunction, which result in
life-threatening infections. Early diagnosis of SCID through population-based
screening of newborns can aid clinical management and help improve outcomes; it
also permits the identification of previously unknown factors that are essential 
for lymphocyte development in humans.
METHODS: SCID was detected in a newborn before the onset of infections by means
of screening of T-cell-receptor excision circles, a biomarker for thymic output. 
On confirmation of the condition, the affected infant was treated with allogeneic
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Exome sequencing in the patient and
parents was followed by functional analysis of a prioritized candidate gene with 
the use of human hematopoietic stem cells and zebrafish embryos.
RESULTS: The infant had "leaky" SCID (i.e., a form of SCID in which a minimal
degree of immune function is preserved), as well as craniofacial and dermal
abnormalities and the absence of a corpus callosum; his immune deficit was fully 
corrected by hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Exome sequencing revealed a
heterozygous de novo missense mutation, p.N441K, in BCL11B. The resulting BCL11B 
protein had dominant negative activity, which abrogated the ability of wild-type 
BCL11B to bind DNA, thereby arresting development of the T-cell lineage and
disrupting hematopoietic stem-cell migration; this revealed a previously unknown 
function of BCL11B. The patient's abnormalities, when recapitulated in
bcl11ba-deficient zebrafish, were reversed by ectopic expression of functionally 
intact human BCL11B but not mutant human BCL11B.
CONCLUSIONS: Newborn screening facilitated the identification and treatment of a 
previously unknown cause of human SCID. Coupling exome sequencing with an
evaluation of candidate genes in human hematopoietic stem cells and in zebrafish 
revealed that a constitutional BCL11B mutation caused human multisystem anomalies
with SCID and also revealed a prethymic role for BCL11B in hematopoietic
progenitors. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

Options for people with severe paralysis who have lost the ability to communicate
orally are limited. We describe a method for communication in a patient with
late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), involving a fully implanted
brain-computer interface that consists of subdural electrodes placed over the
motor cortex and a transmitter placed subcutaneously in the left side of the
thorax. By attempting to move the hand on the side opposite the implanted
electrodes, the patient accurately and independently controlled a computer typing
program 28 weeks after electrode placement, at the equivalent of two letters per 
minute. The brain-computer interface offered autonomous communication that
supplemented and at times supplanted the patient's eye-tracking device. (Funded

We identified a polyclonal CD8+ T-cell response against mutant KRAS G12D in
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from a patient with metastatic colorectal
cancer. We observed objective regression of all seven lung metastases after the
infusion of approximately 1.11×1011 HLA-C*08:02-restricted tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes that were composed of four different T-cell clonotypes that
specifically targeted KRAS G12D. However, one of these lesions had progressed on 
evaluation 9 months after therapy. The lesion was resected and found to have lost
the chromosome 6 haplotype encoding the HLA-C*08:02 class I major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The loss of expression of this
molecule provided a direct mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Thus, the infusion 
of CD8+ cells targeting mutant KRAS mediated effective antitumor immunotherapy
against a cancer that expressed mutant KRAS G12D and HLA-C*08:02.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved clinical outcomes associated with
numerous cancers, but high-grade, immune-related adverse events can occur,
particularly with combination immunotherapy. We report the cases of two patients 
with melanoma in whom fatal myocarditis developed after treatment with ipilimumab
and nivolumab. In both patients, there was development of myositis with
rhabdomyolysis, early progressive and refractory cardiac electrical instability, 
and myocarditis with a robust presence of T-cell and macrophage infiltrates.
Selective clonal T-cell populations infiltrating the myocardium were identical to
those present in tumors and skeletal muscle. Pharmacovigilance studies show that 
myocarditis occurred in 0.27% of patients treated with a combination of
ipilimumab and nivolumab, which suggests that our patients were having a rare,
potentially fatal, T-cell-driven drug reaction. (Funded by Vanderbilt-Ingram

BACKGROUND: The senses of touch and proprioception evoke a range of perceptions
and rely on the ability to detect and transduce mechanical force. The molecular
and neural mechanisms underlying these sensory functions remain poorly defined.
The stretch-gated ion channel PIEZO2 has been shown to be essential for aspects
of mechanosensation in model organisms.
METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing analysis in two patients who had
unique neuromuscular and skeletal symptoms, including progressive scoliosis, that
did not conform to standard diagnostic classification. In vitro and messenger RNA
assays, functional brain imaging, and psychophysical and kinematic tests were
used to establish the effect of the genetic variants on protein function and
somatosensation.
RESULTS: Each patient carried compound-inactivating variants in PIEZO2, and each 
had a selective loss of discriminative touch perception but nevertheless
responded to specific types of gentle mechanical stimulation on hairy skin. The
patients had profoundly decreased proprioception leading to ataxia and dysmetria 
that were markedly worse in the absence of visual cues. However, they had the
ability to perform a range of tasks, such as walking, talking, and writing, that 
are considered to rely heavily on proprioception.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PIEZO2 is a determinant of mechanosensation in
humans. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research

Scrub typhus is a life-threatening zoonosis caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi
organisms that are transmitted by the larvae of trombiculid mites. Endemic scrub 
typhus was originally thought to be confined to the so called "tsutsugamushi
triangle" within the Asia-Pacific region. In 2006, however, two individual cases 
were detected in the Middle East and South America, which suggested that the
pathogen was present farther afield. Here, we report three autochthonous cases of
scrub typhus caused by O. tsutsugamushi acquired on Chiloé Island in southern
Chile, which suggests the existence of an endemic focus in South America. (Funded

BACKGROUND: Cortical-bone fragility is a common feature in osteoporosis that is
linked to nonvertebral fractures. Regulation of cortical-bone homeostasis has
proved elusive. The study of genetic disorders of the skeleton can yield insights
that fuel experimental therapeutic approaches to the treatment of rare disorders 
and common skeletal ailments.
METHODS: We evaluated four patients with Pyle's disease, a genetic disorder that 
is characterized by cortical-bone thinning, limb deformity, and fractures; two
patients were examined by means of exome sequencing, and two were examined by
means of Sanger sequencing. After a candidate gene was identified, we generated a
knockout mouse model that manifested the phenotype and studied the mechanisms
responsible for altered bone architecture.
RESULTS: In all affected patients, we found biallelic truncating mutations in
SFRP4, the gene encoding secreted frizzled-related protein 4, a soluble Wnt
inhibitor. Mice deficient in Sfrp4, like persons with Pyle's disease, have
increased amounts of trabecular bone and unusually thin cortical bone, as a
result of differential regulation of Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
signaling in these two bone compartments. Treatment of Sfrp4-deficient mice with 
a soluble Bmp2 receptor (RAP-661) or with antibodies to sclerostin corrected the 
cortical-bone defect.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that Pyle's disease was caused by a deficiency of
sFRP4, that cortical-bone and trabecular-bone homeostasis were governed by
different mechanisms, and that sFRP4-mediated cross-regulation between Wnt and
BMP signaling was critical for achieving proper cortical-bone thickness and
stability. (Funded by the Swiss National Foundation and the National Institutes

BACKGROUND: Three pregnancies with male offspring in one family were complicated 
by severe polyhydramnios and prematurity. One fetus died; the other two had
transient massive salt-wasting and polyuria reminiscent of antenatal Bartter's
syndrome.
METHODS: To uncover the molecular cause of this possibly X-linked disease, we
performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA from two members of the index family and 
targeted gene analysis of other members of this family and of six additional
families with affected male fetuses. We also evaluated a series of women with
idiopathic polyhydramnios who were pregnant with male fetuses. We performed
immunohistochemical analysis, knockdown and overexpression experiments, and
protein-protein interaction studies.
RESULTS: We identified a mutation in MAGED2 in each of the 13 infants in our
analysis who had transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome. MAGED2 encodes
melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) and maps to the X chromosome. We also
identified two different MAGED2 mutations in two families with idiopathic
polyhydramnios. Four patients died perinatally, and 11 survived. The initial
presentation was more severe than in known types of antenatal Bartter's syndrome,
as reflected by an earlier onset of polyhydramnios and labor. All symptoms
disappeared spontaneously during follow-up in the infants who survived. We showed
that MAGE-D2 affects the expression and function of the sodium chloride
cotransporters NKCC2 and NCC (key components of salt reabsorption in the distal
renal tubule), possibly through adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP signaling and a 
cytoplasmic heat-shock protein.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that MAGED2 mutations caused X-linked polyhydramnios with
prematurity and a severe but transient form of antenatal Bartter's syndrome.
MAGE-D2 is essential for fetal renal salt reabsorption, amniotic fluid
homeostasis, and the maintenance of pregnancy. (Funded by the University of

The current outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been associated with an
apparent increased risk of congenital microcephaly. We describe a case of a
pregnant woman and her fetus infected with ZIKV during the 11th gestational week.
The fetal head circumference decreased from the 47th percentile to the 24th
percentile between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation. ZIKV RNA was identified in
maternal serum at 16 and 21 weeks of gestation. At 19 and 20 weeks of gestation, 
substantial brain abnormalities were detected on ultrasonography and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) without the presence of microcephaly or intracranial
calcifications. On postmortem analysis of the fetal brain, diffuse cerebral
cortical thinning, high ZIKV RNA loads, and viral particles were detected, and
ZIKV was subsequently isolated.

A widespread epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was reported in 2015 in
South and Central America and the Caribbean. A major concern associated with this
infection is the apparent increased incidence of microcephaly in fetuses born to 
mothers infected with ZIKV. In this report, we describe the case of an expectant 
mother who had a febrile illness with rash at the end of the first trimester of
pregnancy while she was living in Brazil. Ultrasonography performed at 29 weeks
of gestation revealed microcephaly with calcifications in the fetal brain and
placenta. After the mother requested termination of the pregnancy, a fetal
autopsy was performed. Micrencephaly (an abnormally small brain) was observed,
with almost complete agyria, hydrocephalus, and multifocal dystrophic
calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, with associated
cortical displacement and mild focal inflammation. ZIKV was found in the fetal
brain tissue on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay,
with consistent findings on electron microscopy. The complete genome of ZIKV was 
recovered from the fetal brain.

In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung 
cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK
kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine
by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a
second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), 
a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the
resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y
mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric
interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to
crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to 
crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related
symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others;
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).

Neoplasms occur naturally in invertebrates but are not known to develop in
tapeworms. We observed nests of monomorphic, undifferentiated cells in samples
from lymph-node and lung biopsies in a man infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The morphologic features and invasive behavior of
the cells were characteristic of cancer, but their small size suggested a
nonhuman origin. A polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay targeting eukaryotes
identified Hymenolepis nana DNA. Although the cells were unrecognizable as
tapeworm tissue, immunohistochemical staining and probe hybridization labeled the
cells in situ. Comparative deep sequencing identified H. nana structural genomic 
variants that are compatible with mutations described in cancer. Invasion of
human tissue by abnormal, proliferating, genetically altered tapeworm cells is a 
novel disease mechanism that links infection and cancer.

A suspected case of sexual transmission from a male survivor of Ebola virus
disease (EVD) to his female partner (the patient in this report) occurred in
Liberia in March 2015. Ebola virus (EBOV) genomes assembled from blood samples
from the patient and a semen sample from the survivor were consistent with direct
transmission. The genomes shared three substitutions that were absent from all
other Western African EBOV sequences and that were distinct from the last
documented transmission chain in Liberia before this case. Combined with
epidemiologic data, the genomic analysis provides evidence of sexual transmission
of EBOV and evidence of the persistence of infective EBOV in semen for 179 days
or more after the onset of EVD. (Funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency

Recent discoveries of somatic mutations permit the recognition of subtypes of
aldosterone-producing adenomas with distinct clinical presentations and
pathological features. Here we describe three women with hyperaldosteronism, two 
who presented in pregnancy and one who presented after menopause. Their
aldosterone-producing adenomas harbored activating mutations of CTNNB1, encoding 
β-catenin in the Wnt cell-differentiation pathway, and expressed LHCGR and GNRHR,
encoding gonadal receptors, at levels that were more than 100 times as high as
the levels in other aldosterone-producing adenomas. The mutations stimulate Wnt
activation and cause adrenocortical cells to de-differentiate toward their common
adrenal-gonadal precursor cell type. (Funded by grants from the National
Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre and others.).

A patient with refractory multiple myeloma received an infusion of CTL019 cells, 
a cellular therapy consisting of autologous T cells transduced with an anti-CD19 
chimeric antigen receptor, after myeloablative chemotherapy (melphalan, 140 mg
per square meter of body-surface area) and autologous stem-cell transplantation. 
Four years earlier, autologous transplantation with a higher melphalan dose (200 
mg per square meter) had induced only a partial, transient response. Autologous
transplantation followed by treatment with CTL019 cells led to a complete
response with no evidence of progression and no measurable serum or urine
monoclonal protein at the most recent evaluation, 12 months after treatment. This
response was achieved despite the absence of CD19 expression in 99.95% of the
patient's neoplastic plasma cells. (Funded by Novartis and others;

Familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer accounts for 3 to 9% of all cases of thyroid
cancer, but the susceptibility genes are not known. Here, we report a germline
variant of HABP2 in seven affected members of a kindred with familial
nonmedullary thyroid cancer and in 4.7% of 423 patients with thyroid cancer. This
variant was associated with increased HABP2 protein expression in tumor samples
from affected family members, as compared with normal adjacent thyroid tissue and
samples from sporadic cancers. Functional studies showed that HABP2 has a
tumor-suppressive effect, whereas the G534E variant results in loss of function.

Between 2011 and 2013, three breeders of variegated squirrels (Sciurus
variegatoides) had encephalitis with similar clinical signs and died 2 to 4
months after onset of the clinical symptoms. With the use of a metagenomic
approach that incorporated next-generation sequencing and real-time
reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the
presence of a previously unknown bornavirus was detected in a contact squirrel
and in brain samples from the three patients. Phylogenetic analyses showed that
this virus, tentatively named variegated squirrel 1 bornavirus (VSBV-1), forms a 
lineage separate from that of the known bornavirus species. (Funded by the

Background Combined immunodeficiencies are marked by inborn errors of T-cell
immunity in which the T cells that are present are quantitatively or functionally
deficient. Impaired humoral immunity is also common. Patients have severe
infections, autoimmunity, or both. The specific molecular, cellular, and clinical
features of many types of combined immunodeficiencies remain unknown. Methods We 
performed genetic and cellular immunologic studies involving five unrelated
children with early-onset invasive bacterial and viral infections, lymphopenia,
and defective T-cell, B-cell, and natural killer (NK)-cell responses. Two
patients died early in childhood; after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell
transplantation, the other three had normalization of T-cell function and
clinical improvement. Results We identified biallelic mutations in the dedicator 
of cytokinesis 2 gene (DOCK2) in these five patients. RAC1 activation was
impaired in the T cells. Chemokine-induced migration and actin polymerization
were defective in the T cells, B cells, and NK cells. NK-cell degranulation was
also affected. Interferon-α and interferon-λ production by peripheral-blood
mononuclear cells was diminished after viral infection. Moreover, in
DOCK2-deficient fibroblasts, viral replication was increased and virus-induced
cell death was enhanced; these conditions were normalized by treatment with
interferon alfa-2b or after expression of wild-type DOCK2. Conclusions Autosomal 
recessive DOCK2 deficiency is a new mendelian disorder with pleiotropic defects
of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic immunity. Children with clinical features
of combined immunodeficiencies, especially with early-onset, invasive infections,
may have this condition. (Supported by the National Institutes of Health and

Among the survivors of Ebola virus disease (EVD), complications that include
uveitis can develop during convalescence, although the incidence and pathogenesis
of EVD-associated uveitis are unknown. We describe a patient who recovered from
EVD and was subsequently found to have severe unilateral uveitis during
convalescence. Viable Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) was detected in aqueous humor 14
weeks after the onset of EVD and 9 weeks after the clearance of viremia.

Investigations of noninvasive prenatal screening for aneuploidy by analysis of
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown high sensitivity and specificity in 
both high-risk and low-risk cohorts. However, the overall low incidence of
aneuploidy limits the positive predictive value of these tests. Currently, the
causes of false positive results are poorly understood. We investigated four
pregnancies with discordant prenatal test results and found in two cases that
maternal duplications on chromosome 18 were the likely cause of the discordant
results. Modeling based on population-level copy-number variation supports the
possibility that some false positive results of noninvasive prenatal screening
may be attributable to large maternal copy-number variants. (Funded by the
National Institutes of Health and others.).

During 2013, cutaneous lesions developed in two men in the country of Georgia
after they were exposed to ill cows. The men had never received vaccination
against smallpox. Tests of lesion material with the use of a quantitative
real-time polymerase-chain-reaction assay for non-variola virus orthopoxviruses
were positive, and DNA sequence analysis implicated a novel orthopoxvirus
species. During the ensuing epidemiologic investigation, no additional human
cases were identified. However, serologic evidence of exposure to an
orthopoxvirus was detected in cows in the patients' herd and in captured rodents 
and shrews. A third case of human infection that occurred in 2010 was diagnosed
retrospectively during testing of archived specimens that were originally
submitted for tests to detect anthrax. Orthopoxvirus infection should be
considered in persons in whom cutaneous lesions develop after contact with
animals.

Mutations in the gene encoding leptin (LEP) typically lead to an absence of
circulating leptin and to extreme obesity. We describe a 2-year-old boy with
early-onset extreme obesity due to a novel homozygous transversion (c.298G→T) in 
LEP, leading to a change from aspartic acid to tyrosine at amino acid position
100 (p.D100Y) and high immunoreactive levels of leptin. Overexpression studies
confirmed that the mutant protein is secreted but neither binds to nor activates 
the leptin receptor. The mutant protein failed to reduce food intake and body
weight in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Treatment of the patient with recombinant 
human leptin (metreleptin) rapidly normalized eating behavior and resulted in
weight loss.

West Africa is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease
(EVD) in history. Two patients with EVD were transferred from Liberia to our
hospital in the United States for ongoing care. Malaria had also been diagnosed
in one patient, who was treated for it early in the course of EVD. The two
patients had substantial intravascular volume depletion and marked electrolyte
abnormalities. We undertook aggressive supportive measures of hydration
(typically, 3 to 5 liters of intravenous fluids per day early in the course of
care) and electrolyte correction. As the patients' condition improved clinically,
there was a concomitant decline in the amount of virus detected in plasma.

Ebola virus disease (EVD) developed in a patient who contracted the disease in
Sierra Leone and was airlifted to an isolation facility in Hamburg, Germany, for 
treatment. During the course of the illness, he had numerous complications,
including septicemia, respiratory failure, and encephalopathy. Intensive
supportive treatment consisting of high-volume fluid resuscitation (approximately
10 liters per day in the first 72 hours), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and 
ventilatory support resulted in full recovery without the use of experimental
therapies. Discharge was delayed owing to the detection of viral RNA in urine
(day 30) and sweat (at the last assessment on day 40) by means of
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, but the last positive culture was
identified in plasma on day 14 and in urine on day 26. This case shows the
challenges in the management of EVD and suggests that even severe EVD can be
treated effectively with routine intensive care.

Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), is
effective in treating tumors harboring alterations in the mTOR pathway.
Mechanisms of resistance to everolimus remain undefined. Resistance developed in 
a patient with metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma after an extraordinary
18-month response. Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment and drug-resistant
tumors revealed a nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR,
suggesting a mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. The resistant
tumor also harbored a mutation in MTOR that confers resistance to allosteric mTOR
inhibition. The mutation remains sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors.

A 14-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency presented three times to 
a medical facility over a period of 4 months with fever and headache that
progressed to hydrocephalus and status epilepticus necessitating a medically
induced coma. Diagnostic workup including brain biopsy was unrevealing. Unbiased 
next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid identified 475 of 3,063,784
sequence reads (0.016%) corresponding to leptospira infection. Clinical assays
for leptospirosis were negative. Targeted antimicrobial agents were administered,
and the patient was discharged home 32 days later with a status close to his
premorbid condition. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) and serologic testing at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) subsequently confirmed evidence 
of Leptospira santarosai infection.

We describe the isolation and sequencing of Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) obtained from a dromedary camel and from a patient who
died of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection after close contact with camels
that had rhinorrhea. Nasal swabs collected from the patient and from one of his
nine camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA. In addition, MERS-CoV was isolated
from the patient and the camel. The full genome sequences of the two isolates
were identical. Serologic data indicated that MERS-CoV was circulating in the
camels but not in the patient before the human infection occurred. These data
suggest that this fatal case of human MERS-CoV infection was transmitted through 
close contact with an infected camel.

We report the case of a patient from Brazil with a bloodstream infection caused
by a strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that was
susceptible to vancomycin (designated BR-VSSA) but that acquired the vanA gene
cluster during antibiotic therapy and became resistant to vancomycin (designated 
BR-VRSA). Both strains belong to the sequence type (ST) 8 community-associated
genetic lineage that carries the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec)
type IVa and the S. aureus protein A gene (spa) type t292 and are
phylogenetically related to MRSA lineage USA300. A conjugative plasmid of 55,706 
bp (pBRZ01) carrying the vanA cluster was identified and readily transferred to
other staphylococci. The pBRZ01 plasmid harbors DNA sequences that are typical of
the plasmid-associated replication genes rep24 or rep21 described in
community-associated MRSA strains from Australia (pWBG745). The presence and
dissemination of community-associated MRSA containing vanA could become a serious
public health concern.

Genetic defects in MOGS, the gene encoding mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase
(the first enzyme in the processing pathway of N-linked oligosaccharide), cause
the rare congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIb (CDG-IIb), also known as
MOGS-CDG. MOGS is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the
trimming of N-glycans. We evaluated two siblings with CDG-IIb who presented with 
multiple neurologic complications and a paradoxical immunologic phenotype
characterized by severe hypogammaglobulinemia but limited clinical evidence of an
infectious diathesis. A shortened immunoglobulin half-life was determined to be
the mechanism underlying the hypogammaglobulinemia. Impaired viral replication
and cellular entry may explain a decreased susceptibility to infections.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are resistant to traditional chemotherapy
but are responsive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and sunitinib. The 
use of these agents has improved the outcome for patients but is associated with 
adverse effects, including hypothyroidism. Multiple mechanisms of this effect
have been proposed, including decreased iodine organification and glandular
capillary regression. Here we report the finding of consumptive hypothyroidism
caused by marked overexpression of the thyroid hormone-inactivating enzyme type 3
iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) within the tumor. Affected patients warrant
increased monitoring and may require supernormal thyroid hormone supplementation.

The human zona pellucida is composed of four glycoproteins (ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, and
ZP4) and has an important role in reproduction. Here we describe a form of
infertility with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized by
abnormal eggs that lack a zona pellucida. We identified a homozygous frameshift
mutation in ZP1 in six family members. In vitro studies showed that defective ZP1
proteins and normal ZP3 proteins colocalized throughout the cells and were not
expressed at the cell surface, suggesting that the aberrant ZP1 results in the
sequestration of ZP3 in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing the formation of the
zona pellucida around the oocyte.

Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common cause of severe, persistent
neonatal hypoglycemia. The treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia that is
unresponsive to diazoxide is subtotal pancreatectomy. We examined the
effectiveness of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor sirolimus in 
four infants with severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia that had been unresponsive
to maximal doses of diazoxide (20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) and
octreotide (35 μg per kilogram per day). All the patients had a clear glycemic
response to sirolimus, although one patient required a small dose of octreotide
to maintain normoglycemia. There were no major adverse events during 1 year of
follow-up.

Premature ovarian failure is a major cause of female infertility. The genetic
causes of this disorder remain unknown in most patients. Using whole-exome
sequence analysis of a large consanguineous family with inherited premature
ovarian failure, we identified a homozygous 1-bp deletion inducing a frameshift
mutation in STAG3 on chromosome 7. STAG3 encodes a meiosis-specific subunit of
the cohesin ring, which ensures correct sister chromatid cohesion. Female mice

BACKGROUND: Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous
group of heritable deficiencies of humoral and cell-mediated immunity. Many
patients with SCID have lymphocyte-activation defects that remain
uncharacterized.
METHODS: We performed genetic studies in four patients, from four families of
Northern Cree ancestry, who had clinical characteristics of SCID, including early
onset of severe viral, bacterial, and fungal infections despite normal B-cell and
T-cell counts. Genomewide homozygosity mapping was used to identify a candidate
region, which was found on chromosome 8; all genes within this interval were
sequenced. Immune-cell populations, signal transduction on activation, and
effector functions were studied.
RESULTS: The patients had hypogammaglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia, and their 
peripheral-blood B cells and T cells were almost exclusively of naive phenotype. 
Regulatory T cells and γδ T cells were absent. All patients carried a homozygous 
duplication--c.1292dupG in exon 13 of IKBKB, which encodes IκB kinase 2 (IKK2,
also known as IKKβ)--leading to loss of expression of IKK2, a component of the
IKK-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Immune cells from the patients had
impaired responses to stimulation through T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors,
toll-like receptors, inflammatory cytokine receptors, and mitogens.
CONCLUSIONS: A form of human SCID is characterized by normal lymphocyte
development despite a loss of IKK2 function. IKK2 deficiency results in an
impaired response to activation stimuli in a variety of immune cells, leading to 
clinically relevant impairment of adaptive and innate immunity. Although Ikk2
deficiency is lethal in mouse embryos, our observations suggest a more
restricted, unique role of IKK2-NF-κB signaling in humans. (Funded by the German

Hyperprolactinemia that is not associated with gestation or the puerperium is
usually due to tumors in the anterior pituitary gland and occurs occasionally in 
hereditary multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes. Here, we report data from
three sisters with hyperprolactinemia, two of whom presented with oligomenorrhea 
and one with infertility. These symptoms were not associated with pituitary
tumors or multiple endocrine neoplasia but were due to a heterozygous mutation in
the prolactin receptor gene, PRLR, resulting in an amino acid change from
histidine to arginine at codon 188 (His188Arg). This substitution disrupted the
high-affinity ligand-binding interface of the prolactin receptor, resulting in a 
loss of downstream signaling by Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and
activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Thus, the familial hyperprolactinemia
appears to be due to a germline, loss-of-function mutation in PRLR, resulting in 
prolactin insensitivity.

An infant born to a woman with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
infection began receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) 30 hours after birth owing
to high-risk exposure. ART was continued when detection of HIV-1 DNA and RNA on
repeat testing met the standard diagnostic criteria for infection. After therapy 
was discontinued (when the child was 18 months of age), levels of plasma HIV-1
RNA, proviral DNA in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells, and HIV-1 antibodies, as
assessed by means of clinical assays, remained undetectable in the child through 
30 months of age. This case suggests that very early ART in infants may alter the
establishment and long-term persistence of HIV-1 infection.

The clinical application of robotic technology to powered prosthetic knees and
ankles is limited by the lack of a robust control strategy. We found that the use
of electromyographic (EMG) signals from natively innervated and surgically
reinnervated residual thigh muscles in a patient who had undergone knee
amputation improved control of a robotic leg prosthesis. EMG signals were decoded
with a pattern-recognition algorithm and combined with data from sensors on the
prosthesis to interpret the patient's intended movements. This provided robust
and intuitive control of ambulation--with seamless transitions between walking on
level ground, stairs, and ramps--and of the ability to reposition the leg while
the patient was seated.

BACKGROUND: The eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis (VEE) viruses are pathogens that infect humans and horses in the
Americas. Outbreaks of neurologic disease in humans and horses were reported in
Panama from May through early August 2010.
METHODS: We performed antibody assays and tests to detect viral RNA and isolate
the viruses in serum samples from hospitalized patients. Additional cases were
identified with enhanced surveillance.
RESULTS: A total of 19 patients were hospitalized for encephalitis. Among them, 7
had confirmed EEE, 3 had VEE, and 1 was infected with both viruses; 3 patients
died, 1 of whom had confirmed VEE. The clinical findings for patients with EEE
included brain lesions, seizures that evolved to status epilepticus, and
neurologic sequelae. An additional 99 suspected or probable cases of alphavirus
infection were detected during active surveillance. In total, 13 cases were
confirmed as EEE, along with 11 cases of VEE and 1 case of dual infection. A
total of 50 cases in horses were confirmed as EEE and 8 as VEE; mixed etiologic
factors were associated with 11 cases in horses. Phylogenetic analyses of
isolates from 2 cases of equine infection with the EEE virus and 1 case of human 
infection with the VEE virus indicated that the viruses were of enzootic lineages
previously identified in Panama rather than new introductions.
CONCLUSIONS: Cases of EEE in humans in Latin America may be the result of
ecologic changes that increased human contact with enzootic transmission cycles, 
genetic changes in EEE viral strains that resulted in increased human virulence, 
or an altered host range. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and the

Although androgen resistance has been characterized in men with a normal
chromosome complement and mutations in the androgen-receptor gene, a mutation in 
the gene encoding estrogen receptor α (ESR1) was previously described only in one
man and not, to our knowledge, in a woman. We now describe an 18-year-old woman
without breast development and with markedly elevated serum levels of estrogens
and bilateral multicystic ovaries. She was found to have a homozygous
loss-of-function ESR1 mutation in a completely conserved residue that interferes 
with estrogen signaling. Her clinical presentation was similar to that in the
mouse orthologue knockout. This case shows that disruption of ESR1 causes
profound estrogen resistance in women. (Funded by the National Institutes of
Health.).

Crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has also recently
shown efficacy in the treatment of lung cancers with ROS1 translocations.
Resistance to crizotinib developed in a patient with metastatic lung
adenocarcinoma harboring a CD74-ROS1 rearrangement who had initially shown a
dramatic response to treatment. We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and
identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at 
codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the 
gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through
steric interference with drug binding. The same resistance mutation was observed 
at all the metastatic sites that were examined at autopsy, suggesting that this
mutation was an early event in the clonal evolution of resistance. (Funded by
Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).

A human coronavirus, called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), was first identified in September 2012 in samples obtained from a
Saudi Arabian businessman who died from acute respiratory failure. Since then, 49
cases of infections caused by MERS-CoV (previously called a novel coronavirus)
with 26 deaths have been reported to date. In this report, we describe a family
case cluster of MERS-CoV infection, including the clinical presentation,
treatment outcomes, and household relationships of three young men who became ill
with MERS-CoV infection after the hospitalization of an elderly male relative,
who died of the disease. Twenty-four other family members living in the same
household and 124 attending staff members at the hospitals did not become ill.
MERS-CoV infection may cause a spectrum of clinical illness. Although an animal
reservoir is suspected, none has been discovered. Meanwhile, global concern rests
on the ability of MERS-CoV to cause major illness in close contacts of patients.

BACKGROUND: Infection of poultry with influenza A subtype H7 viruses occurs
worldwide, but the introduction of this subtype to humans in Asia has not been
observed previously. In March 2013, three urban residents of Shanghai or Anhui,
China, presented with rapidly progressing lower respiratory tract infections and 
were found to be infected with a novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A
(H7N9) virus.
METHODS: We obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiologic, and virologic data
from these patients. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and other
respiratory viruses by means of real-time
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays, viral culturing, and
sequence analyses.
RESULTS: A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was isolated
from respiratory specimens obtained from all three patients and was identified as
H7N9. Sequencing analyses revealed that all the genes from these three viruses
were of avian origin, with six internal genes from avian influenza A (H9N2)
viruses. Substitution Q226L (H3 numbering) at the 210-loop in the hemagglutinin
(HA) gene was found in the A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013 virus but not in 
the A/Shanghai/1/2013 virus. A T160A mutation was identified at the 150-loop in
the HA gene of all three viruses. A deletion of five amino acids in the
neuraminidase (NA) stalk region was found in all three viruses. All three
patients presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea. Two of the patients had a
history of recent exposure to poultry. Chest radiography revealed diffuse
opacities and consolidation. Complications included acute respiratory distress
syndrome and multiorgan failure. All three patients died.
CONCLUSIONS: Novel reassortant H7N9 viruses were associated with severe and fatal
respiratory disease in three patients. (Funded by the National Basic Research
Program of China and others.).

Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells with specificity for CD19 have shown
promise in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It remains to be 
established whether chimeric antigen receptor T cells have clinical activity in
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Two children with relapsed and refractory
pre-B-cell ALL received infusions of T cells transduced with anti-CD19 antibody
and a T-cell signaling molecule (CTL019 chimeric antigen receptor T cells), at a 
dose of 1.4×10(6) to 1.2×10(7) CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. In both 
patients, CTL019 T cells expanded to a level that was more than 1000 times as
high as the initial engraftment level, and the cells were identified in bone
marrow. In addition, the chimeric antigen receptor T cells were observed in the
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where they persisted at high levels for at least 6
months. Eight grade 3 or 4 adverse events were noted. The cytokine-release
syndrome and B-cell aplasia developed in both patients. In one child, the
cytokine-release syndrome was severe; cytokine blockade with etanercept and
tocilizumab was effective in reversing the syndrome and did not prevent expansion
of chimeric antigen receptor T cells or reduce antileukemic efficacy. Complete
remission was observed in both patients and is ongoing in one patient at 11
months after treatment. The other patient had a relapse, with blast cells that no
longer expressed CD19, approximately 2 months after treatment. Chimeric antigen
receptor-modified T cells are capable of killing even aggressive,
treatment-refractory acute leukemia cells in vivo. The emergence of tumor cells
that no longer express the target indicates a need to target other molecules in
addition to CD19 in some patients with ALL.

Ixodes ticks serve as vectors for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme
disease. Globally, these ticks often concurrently harbor B. miyamotoi, a
spirochete that is classified within the relapsing-fever group of spirochetes.
Although humans presumably are exposed to B. miyamotoi, there are limited data
suggesting disease attributable to it. We report a case of progressive mental
deterioration in an older, immunocompromised patient, and even though Koch's
postulates were not met, we posit B. miyamotoi as the cause, owing to its direct 
detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the use of microscopy and a
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay. It is likely that B. miyamotoi is an
underrecognized cause of disease, especially in sites where Lyme disease is
endemic.

Conventional cytogenetic testing offers low-resolution detection of balanced
karyotypic abnormalities but cannot provide the precise, gene-level knowledge
required to predict outcomes. The use of high-resolution whole-genome deep
sequencing is currently impractical for the purpose of routine clinical care. We 
show here that whole-genome "jumping libraries" can offer an immediately
applicable, nucleotide-level complement to conventional genetic diagnostics
within a time frame that allows for clinical action. We performed large-insert
sequencing of DNA extracted from amniotic-fluid cells with a balanced de novo
translocation. The amniotic-fluid sample was from a patient in the third
trimester of pregnancy who underwent amniocentesis because of severe
polyhydramnios after multiple fetal anomalies had been detected on
ultrasonography. Using a 13-day sequence and analysis pipeline, we discovered
direct disruption of CHD7, a causal locus in the CHARGE syndrome (coloboma of the
eye, heart anomaly, atresia of the choanae, retardation, and genital and ear
anomalies). Clinical findings at birth were consistent with the CHARGE syndrome, 
a diagnosis that could not have been reliably inferred from the cytogenetic
breakpoint. This case study illustrates the potential power of customized
whole-genome jumping libraries when used to augment prenatal karyotyping.

Vemurafenib, a selective RAF inhibitor, extends survival among patients with BRAF
V600E-mutant melanoma. Vemurafenib inhibits ERK signaling in BRAF V600E-mutant
cells but activates ERK signaling in BRAF wild-type cells. This paradoxical
activation of ERK signaling is the mechanistic basis for the development of
RAS-mutant squamous-cell skin cancers in patients treated with RAF inhibitors. We
report the accelerated growth of a previously unsuspected RAS-mutant leukemia in 
a patient with melanoma who was receiving vemurafenib. Exposure to vemurafenib
induced hyperactivation of ERK signaling and proliferation of the leukemic cell
population, an effect that was reversed on drug withdrawal.

Persistent neutrophilic meningitis presents a diagnostic challenge, because the
differential diagnosis is broad and includes atypical infectious causes. We
describe a case of persistent neutrophilic meningitis due to Aspergillus
fumigatus in an immunocompetent man who had no evidence of sinopulmonary or
cutaneous disease. An epidural glucocorticoid injection was identified as a
potential route of entry for this organism into the central nervous system, and
the case was reported to the state health department.

A previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old
man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with a fatal 
outcome in Saudi Arabia. The virus (called HCoV-EMC) replicated readily in cell
culture, producing cytopathic effects of rounding, detachment, and syncytium
formation. The virus represents a novel betacoronavirus species. The closest
known relatives are bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. Here, the clinical data,
virus isolation, and molecular identification are presented. The clinical picture
was remarkably similar to that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak in 2003 and reminds us that animal coronaviruses can cause severe
disease in humans.

A patient with a 20-year history of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis had
progressive, bilateral tumor invasion of the lung parenchyma. We used conditional
reprogramming to generate cell cultures from the patient's normal and tumorous
lung tissue. Analysis revealed that the laryngeal tumor cells contained a
wild-type 7.9-kb human papillomavirus virus type 11 (HPV-11) genome, whereas the 
pulmonary tumor cells contained a 10.4-kb genome. The increased size of the
latter viral genome was due to duplication of the promoter and oncogene regions. 
Chemosensitivity testing identified vorinostat as a potential therapeutic agent. 
At 3 months after treatment initiation, tumor sizes had stabilized, with durable 
effects at 15 months.

Two men from northwestern Missouri independently presented to a medical facility 
with fever, fatigue, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, and both had
been bitten by ticks 5 to 7 days before the onset of illness. Ehrlichia
chaffeensis was suspected as the causal agent but was not found on serologic
analysis, polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, or cell culture. Electron
microscopy revealed viruses consistent with members of the Bunyaviridae family.
Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the viruses as
novel members of the phlebovirus genus. Although Koch's postulates have not been 
completely fulfilled, we believe that this phlebovirus, which is novel in the
Americas, is the cause of this clinical syndrome.

Hypoxia-inducible factors are transcription factors controlling energy, iron
metabolism, erythropoiesis, and development. When these proteins are
dysregulated, they contribute to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. However,
mutations in genes encoding α subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-α) have 
not previously been identified in any cancer. Here we report two novel somatic
gain-of-function mutations in the gene encoding hypoxia-inducible factor 2α
(HIF2A) in two patients, one presenting with paraganglioma and the other with
paraganglioma and somatostatinoma, both of whom had polycythemia. The two
mutations were associated with increased HIF-2α activity and increased protein
half-life.

A 33-year-old woman underwent a right-sided pneumonectomy in 1995 for treatment
of a lung adenocarcinoma. As expected, there was an abrupt decrease in her vital 
capacity, but unexpectedly, it increased during the subsequent 15 years. Serial
computed tomographic (CT) scans showed progressive enlargement of the remaining
left lung and an increase in tissue density. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
with the use of hyperpolarized helium-3 gas showed overall acinar-airway
dimensions that were consistent with an increase in the alveolar number rather
than the enlargement of existing alveoli, but the alveoli in the growing lung
were shallower than in normal lungs. This study provides evidence that new lung
growth can occur in an adult human.

We identified a novel mechanism of hereditary thrombosis associated with
antithrombin resistance, with a substitution of arginine for leucine at position 
596 (p.Arg596Leu) in the gene encoding prothrombin (called prothrombin
Yukuhashi). The mutant prothrombin had moderately lower activity than wild-type
prothrombin in clotting assays, but the formation of thrombin-antithrombin
complex was substantially impaired. A thrombin-generation assay revealed that the
peak activity of the mutant prothrombin was fairly low, but its inactivation was 
extremely slow in reconstituted plasma. The Leu596 substitution caused a
gain-of-function mutation in the prothrombin gene, resulting in resistance to
antithrombin and susceptibility to thrombosis.

Integrin α(3) is a transmembrane integrin receptor subunit that mediates signals 
between the cells and their microenvironment. We identified three patients with
homozygous mutations in the integrin α(3) gene that were associated with
disrupted basement-membrane structures and compromised barrier functions in
kidney, lung, and skin. The patients had a multiorgan disorder that included
congenital nephrotic syndrome, interstitial lung disease, and epidermolysis
bullosa. The renal and respiratory features predominated, and the lung
involvement accounted for the lethal course of the disease. Although skin
fragility was mild, it provided clues to the diagnosis.

The abscopal effect is a phenomenon in which local radiotherapy is associated
with the regression of metastatic cancer at a distance from the irradiated site. 
The abscopal effect may be mediated by activation of the immune system.
Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits an immunologic checkpoint on T 
cells, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). We report a case of 
the abscopal effect in a patient with melanoma treated with ipilimumab and
radiotherapy. Temporal associations were noted: tumor shrinkage with antibody
responses to the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1, changes in peripheral-blood
immune cells, and increases in antibody responses to other antigens after
radiotherapy. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is the central regulator of gonadotropins, 
which stimulate gonadal function. Hypothalamic neurons that produce kisspeptin
and neurokinin B stimulate GnRH release. Inactivating mutations in the genes
encoding the human kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R, formerly called GPR54),
neurokinin B (TAC3), and the neurokinin B receptor (TACR3) result in pubertal
failure. However, human kisspeptin loss-of-function mutations have not been
described, and contradictory findings have been reported in Kiss1-knockout mice. 
We describe an inactivating mutation in KISS1 in a large consanguineous family
that results in failure of pubertal progression, indicating that functional
kisspeptin is important for puberty and reproduction in humans. (Funded by the

Unlike conventional reconstruction, facial transplantation seeks to correct
severe deformities in a single operation. We report on three patients who
received full-face transplants at our institution in 2011 in operations that
aimed for functional restoration by coaptation of all main available motor and
sensory nerves. We enumerate the technical challenges and postoperative
complications and their management, including single episodes of acute rejection 
in two patients. At 6 months of follow-up, all facial allografts were surviving, 
facial appearance and function were improved, and glucocorticoids were
successfully withdrawn in all patients.

Thyroid hormones exert their effects through alpha (TRα1) and beta (TRβ1 and
TRβ2) receptors. Here we describe a child with classic features of hypothyroidism
(growth retardation, developmental retardation, skeletal dysplasia, and severe
constipation) but only borderline-abnormal thyroid hormone levels. Using
whole-exome sequencing, we identified a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in
a gene encoding thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THRA) and generating a mutant
protein that inhibits wild-type receptor action in a dominant negative manner.
Our observations are consistent with defective human TRα-mediated thyroid hormone
resistance and substantiate the concept of hormone action through distinct
receptor subtypes in different target tissues.

We performed genetic and immunohistochemical studies in a sister and brother with
autosomal recessive neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel lesions. The girl died
suddenly at 12 years of age from parvovirus B19-associated myocarditis; her
brother had mild cardiomyopathy. We identified a loss-of-function mutation in
ADAM17, which encodes a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (also called tumor
necrosis factor α [TNF-α]-converting enzyme, or TACE), as the probable cause of
this syndrome. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from the
brother at 17 years of age showed high levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced
production of interleukin-1β and interleukin-6 but impaired release of TNF-α.
Despite repeated skin infections, this young man has led a relatively normal
life. (Funded by Barts and the London Charity and the European Commission Seventh

We designed a lentiviral vector expressing a chimeric antigen receptor with
specificity for the B-cell antigen CD19, coupled with CD137 (a costimulatory
receptor in T cells [4-1BB]) and CD3-zeta (a signal-transduction component of the
T-cell antigen receptor) signaling domains. A low dose (approximately 1.5×10(5)
cells per kilogram of body weight) of autologous chimeric antigen
receptor-modified T cells reinfused into a patient with refractory chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) expanded to a level that was more than 1000 times as
high as the initial engraftment level in vivo, with delayed development of the
tumor lysis syndrome and with complete remission. Apart from the tumor lysis
syndrome, the only other grade 3/4 toxic effect related to chimeric antigen
receptor T cells was lymphopenia. Engineered cells persisted at high levels for 6
months in the blood and bone marrow and continued to express the chimeric antigen
receptor. A specific immune response was detected in the bone marrow, accompanied
by loss of normal B cells and leukemia cells that express CD19. Remission was
ongoing 10 months after treatment. Hypogammaglobulinemia was an expected chronic 
toxic effect.

An outbreak caused by Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli O104:H4 occurred in 
Germany in May and June of 2011, with more than 3000 persons infected. Here, we
report a cluster of cases associated with a single family and describe an
open-source genomic analysis of an isolate from one member of the family. This
analysis involved the use of rapid, bench-top DNA sequencing technology,
open-source data release, and prompt crowd-sourced analyses. In less than a week,
these studies revealed that the outbreak strain belonged to an enteroaggregative 
E. coli lineage that had acquired genes for Shiga toxin 2 and for antibiotic
resistance.

A 44-year-old woman with long-standing common variable immunodeficiency who was
receiving intravenous immune globulin suddenly had paralysis of all four limbs
and the respiratory muscles, resulting in death. Type 2 vaccine-derived
poliovirus was isolated from stool. The viral capsid protein VP1 region had
diverged from the vaccine strain at 12.3% of nucleotide positions, and the two
attenuating substitutions had reverted to the wild-type sequence. Infection
probably occurred 11.9 years earlier (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.9 to
13.2), when her child received the oral poliovirus vaccine. No secondary cases
were identified among close contacts or 2038 screened health care workers.
Patients with common variable immunodeficiency can be chronically infected with
poliovirus, and poliomyelitis can develop despite treatment with intravenous
immune globulin.

BACKGROUND: Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a well-defined clinicopathological
entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure.
METHODS: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively
parallel sequencing of the whole exome of leukemic and matched normal cells
purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were
validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL.
RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations
that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in
BRAF that results in the BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is
oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. 
The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were
evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other
peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF
V600E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or
unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western
blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream
targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the
RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation 
of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720, a
specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK
and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was present in all patients with
HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, 
diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL. (Funded by Associazione Italiana per la
Ricerca sul Cancro and others.).

The skeletal dysplasia characteristic of acrodysostosis resembles the Albright's 
hereditary osteodystrophy seen in patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a,
but defects in the α-stimulatory subunit of the G-protein (GNAS), the cause of
pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, are not present in patients with
acrodysostosis. We report a germ-line mutation in the gene encoding PRKAR1A, the 
cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent regulatory subunit of protein kinase A, in three
unrelated patients with acrodysostosis and resistance to multiple hormones. The
mutated subunit impairs the protein kinase A response to stimulation by cAMP;
this explains our patients' hormone resistance and the similarities of their
skeletal abnormalities with those observed in patients with
pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a.

Globin-gene mutations are a rare but important cause of cyanosis. We identified a
missense mutation in the fetal Gγ-globin gene (HBG2) in a father and daughter
with transient neonatal cyanosis and anemia. This new mutation modifies the
ligand-binding pocket of fetal hemoglobin by means of two mechanisms. First, the 
relatively large side chain of methionine decreases both the affinity of oxygen
for binding to the mutant hemoglobin subunit and the rate at which it does so.
Second, the mutant methionine is converted to aspartic acid post-translationally,
probably through oxidative mechanisms. The presence of this polar amino acid in
the heme pocket is predicted to enhance hemoglobin denaturation, causing anemia.

BACKGROUND: The genetic analysis of human primary immunodeficiencies has defined 
the contribution of specific cell populations and molecular pathways in the host 
defense against infection. Disseminated infection caused by bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines is an early manifestation of primary
immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency. In many affected
persons, the cause of disseminated BCG disease is unexplained.
METHODS: We evaluated an infant presenting with features of severe
immunodeficiency, including early-onset disseminated BCG disease, who required
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We also studied two otherwise healthy
subjects with a history of disseminated but curable BCG disease in childhood. We 
characterized the monocyte and dendritic-cell compartments in these three
subjects and sequenced candidate genes in which mutations could plausibly confer 
susceptibility to BCG disease.
RESULTS: We detected two distinct disease-causing mutations affecting interferon 
regulatory factor 8 (IRF8). Both K108E and T80A mutations impair IRF8
transcriptional activity by disrupting the interaction between IRF8 and DNA. The 
K108E variant was associated with an autosomal recessive severe immunodeficiency 
with a complete lack of circulating monocytes and dendritic cells. The T80A
variant was associated with an autosomal dominant, milder immunodeficiency and a 
selective depletion of CD11c+CD1c+ circulating dendritic cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings define a class of human primary immunodeficiencies
that affect the differentiation of mononuclear phagocytes. They also show that
human IRF8 is critical for the development of monocytes and dendritic cells and
for antimycobacterial immunity. (Funded by the Medical Research Council and

Dystroglycan, which serves as a major extracellular matrix receptor in muscle and
the central nervous system, requires extensive O-glycosylation to function. We
identified a dystroglycan missense mutation (Thr192→Met) in a woman with
limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and cognitive impairment. A mouse model harboring 
this mutation recapitulates the immunohistochemical and neuromuscular
abnormalities observed in the patient. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that
the mutation impairs the receptor function of dystroglycan in skeletal muscle and
brain by inhibiting the post-translational modification, mediated by the
glycosyltransferase LARGE, of the phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycans on
α-dystroglycan that is required for high-affinity binding to laminin.

Perilipin is the most abundant adipocyte-specific protein that coats lipid
droplets, and it is required for optimal lipid incorporation and release from the
droplet. We identified two heterozygous frameshift mutations in the perilipin
gene (PLIN1) in three families with partial lipodystrophy, severe dyslipidemia,
and insulin-resistant diabetes. Subcutaneous fat from the patients was
characterized by smaller-than-normal adipocytes, macrophage infiltration, and
fibrosis. In contrast to wild-type perilipin, mutant forms of the protein failed 
to increase triglyceride accumulation when expressed heterologously in
preadipocytes. These findings define a novel dominant form of inherited
lipodystrophy and highlight the serious metabolic consequences of a primary
defect in the formation of lipid droplets in adipose tissue.

A patient received a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater at 34
years of age. Two decades later, adenomatous polyps were found, followed by
multiple primary invasive adenocarcinomas of both the colon and the stomach.
Premature chromatid separation and mosaic variegated aneuploidy, combined with
structural chromosomal abnormalities, were detected in his cells. We identified a
germline homozygous intronic mutation, c.2386-11A→G, in the spindle-assembly
checkpoint gene BUB1B, which creates a de novo splice site that is favored over
the authentic (i.e., preferentially used) site. Our findings expand the phenotype
associated with BUB1B mutations and the mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome to 
include common adult-onset cancers and provide evidence for the interdependency
of the APC protein (encoded by the adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and the BUBR1
protein (encoded by BUB1B) in humans. (Funded by the Turner Family Cancer

Parapoxviruses are a genus of the double-stranded DNA family of poxviruses that
infect ruminants, and zoonotic transmission to humans often results from
occupational exposures. Parapoxvirus infection in humans begins with an
incubation period of 3 to 7 days, followed by the development of one or more
erythematous maculopapular lesions that evolve over the course of several weeks
into nodules. In 2009, parapoxvirus infection was diagnosed in two deer hunters
in the eastern United States after the hunters had field-dressed white-tailed
deer. We describe the clinical and pathological features of these infections and 
the phylogenetic relationship of a unique strain of parapoxvirus to other
parapoxviruses. Deer populations continue to increase, leading to the possibility
that there will be more deer-associated parapoxvirus infections.

The EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK (anaplastic
lymphoma kinase) fusion-type tyrosine kinase is an oncoprotein found in 4 to 5%
of non-small-cell lung cancers, and clinical trials of specific inhibitors of ALK
for the treatment of such tumors are currently under way. Here, we report the
discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in
tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an
ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor
and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors. (Funded by the

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive mesenchymal neoplasm
characterized by a spindle-cell proliferation with an inflammatory infiltrate.
Approximately half of IMTs carry rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) locus on chromosome 2p23, causing aberrant ALK expression. We report a
sustained partial response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066, Pfizer) 
in a patient with ALK-translocated IMT, as compared with no observed activity in 
another patient without the ALK translocation. These results support the
dependence of ALK-rearranged tumors on ALK-mediated signaling and suggest a
therapeutic strategy for genomically identified patients with the aggressive form
of this soft-tissue tumor. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov

Glycogen, which serves as a major energy reserve in cells, is a large, branched
polymer of glucose molecules. We describe a patient who had muscle weakness,
associated with the depletion of glycogen in skeletal muscle, and cardiac
arrhythmia, associated with the accumulation of abnormal storage material in the 
heart. The skeletal muscle showed a marked predominance of slow-twitch, oxidative
muscle fibers and mitochondrial proliferation. Western blotting showed the
presence of unglucosylated glycogenin-1 in the muscle and heart. Sequencing of
the glycogenin-1 gene, GYG1, revealed a nonsense mutation in one allele and a
missense mutation, Thr83Met, in the other. The missense mutation resulted in
inactivation of the autoglucosylation of glycogenin-1 that is necessary for the
priming of glycogen synthesis in muscle.

Live pentavalent human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine is recommended in the
United States for routine immunization of infants. We describe three infants, two
with failure to thrive, who had dehydration and diarrhea within 1 month after
their first or second rotavirus immunization and subsequently received a
diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency. Rotavirus was detected, by means
of reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, in stool
specimens obtained from all three infants, and gene-sequence analysis revealed
the presence of vaccine rotavirus. These infections raise concerns regarding the 
safety of rotavirus vaccine in severely immunocompromised patients.

Reconstruction of long-segment tracheal defects requires a vascularized
allograft. We report successful tracheal allotransplantation after indirect
revascularization of the graft in a heterotopic position. Immunosuppressive
therapy was administered before the operation, and the tracheal allograft was
wrapped in the recipient's forearm fascia. Once revascularization was achieved,
the mucosal lining was replaced progressively with buccal mucosa from the
recipient. At 4 months, the tracheal chimera was fully lined with mucosa, which
consisted of respiratory epithelium from the donor and buccal mucosa from the
recipient. After withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy, the tracheal allograft 
was moved to its correct anatomical position with an intact blood supply. No
treatment-limiting adverse effects occurred.

    Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2011 Jun;17(6):1438.

BACKGROUND: The molecular cause of inflammatory bowel disease is largely unknown.
METHODS: We performed genetic-linkage analysis and candidate-gene sequencing on
samples from two unrelated consanguineous families with children who were
affected by early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. We screened six additional
patients with early-onset colitis for mutations in two candidate genes and
carried out functional assays in patients' peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. We
performed an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in one patient.
RESULTS: In four of nine patients with early-onset colitis, we identified three
distinct homozygous mutations in genes IL10RA and IL10RB, encoding the IL10R1 and
IL10R2 proteins, respectively, which form a heterotetramer to make up the
interleukin-10 receptor. The mutations abrogate interleukin-10-induced signaling,
as shown by deficient STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) 
phosphorylation on stimulation with interleukin-10. Consistent with this
observation was the increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and other 
proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients
who were deficient in IL10R subunit proteins, suggesting that
interleukin-10-dependent "negative feedback" regulation is disrupted in these
cells. The allogeneic stem-cell transplantation performed in one patient was
successful.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in genes encoding the IL10R subunit proteins were found in
patients with early-onset enterocolitis, involving hyperinflammatory immune
responses in the intestine. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation resulted in
disease remission in one patient.

We report a case of juvenile thrombophilia associated with a substitution of
leucine for arginine at position 338 (R338L) in the factor IX gene (factor
IX-R338L). The level of the mutant factor IX protein in plasma was normal, but
the clotting activity of factor IX from the proband was approximately eight times
the normal level. In vitro, recombinant factor IX-R338L had a specific activity
that was 5 to 10 times as high as that in the recombinant wild-type factor IX.
The R338 substitution causes a gain-of-function mutation, resulting in factor IX 
that is hyperfunctional.

Autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin, which block the inhibitory effect of
osteoprotegerin on signaling by the receptor activator of nuclear factor
(NF)-kappaB (RANK), were identified in a man with celiac disease who presented
with severe osteoporosis and high bone turnover. The osteoporosis did not respond
to the treatment of his celiac disease but was completely reversed by
bisphosphonate therapy. Autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin were detected in
three additional patients with celiac disease. Such autoantibodies may be
associated with the development of high-turnover osteoporosis, but whether
autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of
osteoporosis in patients with celiac disease remains to be determined.

We describe progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by infection 
with human polyomavirus JC virus in a patient with multiple sclerosis who was
treated with natalizumab. The first PML symptoms appeared after 14 monthly
infusions of the drug. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a presumed
multiple sclerosis lesion, and JC virus DNA was not detected on
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay of cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's
symptoms worsened, and the diagnosis of PML was established with a more sensitive
quantitative PCR assay after 16 infusions of natalizumab. Plasma exchange was
used to accelerate clearance of natalizumab. Approximately 3 weeks after plasma
exchange, an immune-reconstitution inflammatory syndrome appeared. JC virus DNA
was no longer detectable on quantitative PCR assay, and the patient's symptoms
improved.

We describe the clinical and therapeutic course of a 52-year-old patient with
multiple sclerosis in whom progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)
developed after 12 months of therapy with natalizumab. The patient was
hospitalized 2 months after the onset of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms and 
was treated with plasma exchange and immunoadsorption to eliminate natalizumab.
After a brief improvement, he became critically ill with an apparent episode of
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Steroid-pulse therapy led to
stabilization of the patient's condition and clinically significant recovery.
This case illustrates that prompt diagnosis and treatment may improve the outcome
in patients with severe PML associated with natalizumab therapy.

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Aberrant
activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway is strongly implicated in the
development of some cases of medulloblastoma. A 26-year-old man with metastatic
medulloblastoma that was refractory to multiple therapies was treated with a
novel hedgehog pathway inhibitor, GDC-0449; treatment resulted in rapid (although
transient) regression of the tumor and reduction of symptoms. Molecular analyses 
of tumor specimens obtained before treatment suggested that there was activation 
of the hedgehog pathway, with loss of heterozygosity and somatic mutation of the 
gene encoding patched homologue 1 (PTCH1), a key negative regulator of hedgehog
signaling.

BACKGROUND: The full complement of DNA mutations that are responsible for the
pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not yet known.
METHODS: We used massively parallel DNA sequencing to obtain a very high level of
coverage (approximately 98%) of a primary, cytogenetically normal, de novo genome
for AML with minimal maturation (AML-M1) and a matched normal skin genome.
RESULTS: We identified 12 acquired (somatic) mutations within the coding
sequences of genes and 52 somatic point mutations in conserved or regulatory
portions of the genome. All mutations appeared to be heterozygous and present in 
nearly all cells in the tumor sample. Four of the 64 mutations occurred in at
least 1 additional AML sample in 188 samples that were tested. Mutations in NRAS 
and NPM1 had been identified previously in patients with AML, but two other
mutations had not been identified. One of these mutations, in the IDH1 gene, was 
present in 15 of 187 additional AML genomes tested and was strongly associated
with normal cytogenetic status; it was present in 13 of 80 cytogenetically normal
samples (16%). The other was a nongenic mutation in a genomic region with
regulatory potential and conservation in higher mammals; we detected it in one
additional AML tumor. The AML genome that we sequenced contains approximately 750
point mutations, of which only a small fraction are likely to be relevant to
pathogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the sequences of tumor and skin genomes of a patient
with AML-M1, we have identified recurring mutations that may be relevant for
pathogenesis.

The mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier isoform 1 (AGC1), specific to
neurons and muscle, supplies aspartate to the cytosol and, as a component of the 
malate-aspartate shuttle, enables mitochondrial oxidation of cytosolic NADH,
thought to be important in providing energy for neurons in the central nervous
system. We describe AGC1 deficiency, a novel syndrome characterized by arrested
psychomotor development, hypotonia, and seizures in a child with a homozygous
missense mutation in the solute carrier family 25, member 12, gene SLC25A12,
which encodes the AGC1 protein. Functional analysis of the mutant AGC1 protein
showed abolished activity. The child had global hypomyelination in the cerebral
hemispheres, suggesting that impaired efflux of aspartate from neuronal
mitochondria prevents normal myelin formation.

We present a case of disseminated histoplasmosis, complicated by retroperitoneal 
bleeding and leading to death, in a patient who was receiving systemic
immunosuppressive therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and who was enrolled in a
gene-therapy trial. This trial was designed to evaluate intraarticular delivery
of a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonist, through an
adeno-associated virus (AAV) type 2 delivery system, for inflammatory arthritis. 
The patient's receipt of concurrent anti-TNF-alpha therapy and other
immunosuppressive therapy while she was living in an area where histoplasmosis
was endemic was thought to be the most likely explanation for the infection; the 
evidence presented suggests that this fatal infection was unlikely to have been
related to exposure to the agent administered in the gene-therapy trial. This
case reinforces the importance of considering infectious complications, such as
those from endemic mycoses, in patients receiving treatment with a TNF-alpha
antagonist and the importance of having a well-designed monitoring plan when
subjects in a research study become ill. (ClinicalTrials.gov number,
NCT00126724.)

Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene and expressed in the lung and liver, is a
recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system.
Heterozygosity for an FCN3 frameshift mutation (rs28357092), leading to a
distortion of the C-terminal end of the molecule, occurs in people without
disease (allele frequency among whites, 0.01). We describe a patient with
recurrent infections who was homozygous for this mutation, who had undetectable
serum levels of ficolin-3, and who had a deficiency in ficolin-3-dependent
complement activation.

We investigated whether mutations in the gene encoding gonadotropin-releasing
hormone 1 (GNRH1) might be responsible for idiopathic hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (IHH) in humans. We identified a homozygous GNRH1 frameshift
mutation, an insertion of an adenine at nucleotide position 18 (c.18-19insA), in 
the sequence encoding the N-terminal region of the signal peptide-containing
protein precursor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (prepro-GnRH) in a teenage
brother and sister, who had normosmic IHH. Their unaffected parents and a sibling
who was tested were heterozygous. This mutation results in an aberrant peptide
lacking the conserved GnRH decapeptide sequence, as shown by the absence of
immunoreactive GnRH when expressed in vitro. This isolated autosomal recessive
GnRH deficiency, reversed by pulsatile GnRH administration, shows the pivotal
role of GnRH in human reproduction.

We describe a patient with an autoinflammatory disease in which the main clinical
features are pustular rash, marked osteopenia, lytic bone lesions, respiratory
insufficiency, and thrombosis. Genetic studies revealed a 175-kb homozygous
deletion at chromosome 2q13, which encompasses several interleukin-1 family
members, including the gene encoding the interleukin-1-receptor antagonist
(IL1RN). Mononuclear cells, obtained from the patient and cultured, produced
large amounts of inflammatory cytokines, with increasing amounts secreted after
stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. A similar increase was not observed in
peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from a patient with neonatal-onset multisystem
inflammatory disorder (NOMID). Treatment with anakinra completely resolved the
symptoms and lesions.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfotransferase, known as SULT2A1, converts the
androgen precursor DHEA to its inactive sulfate ester, DHEAS [corrected], thereby
preventing the conversion of DHEA to an active androgen. SULT2A1 requires
3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) for catalytic activity. We have
identified compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding human PAPS
synthase 2 (PAPSS2) in a girl with premature pubarche, hyperandrogenic
anovulation, very low DHEAS levels, and increased androgen levels. In vitro
coincubation of human SULT2A1 and wild-type or mutant PAPSS2 proteins confirmed
the inactivating nature of the mutations. These observations indicate that PAPSS2
deficiency is a monogenic adrenocortical cause of androgen excess.

Deer tick virus is related to Powassan virus, a tickborne encephalitis virus. A
62-year-old man presented with a meningoencephalitis syndrome and eventually
died. Analyses of tissue samples obtained during surgery and at autopsy revealed 
a widespread necrotizing meningoencephalitis. Nucleic acid was extracted from
formalin-fixed tissue, and the presence of deer tick virus was verified on a
flavivirus-specific polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay, followed by sequence
confirmation. Immunohistochemical analysis with antisera specific for deer tick
virus identified numerous immunoreactive neurons, with prominent involvement of
large neurons in the brain stem, cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, and spinal 
cord. This case demonstrates that deer tick virus can be a cause of fatal
encephalitis.

A mutation in ORAI1, the gene encoding the pore-forming subunit of the
Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channel, abrogates the store-operated
entry of Ca(2+) into cells and impairs lymphocyte activation. Stromal interaction
molecule 1 (STIM1) in the endoplasmic reticulum activates ORAI1-CRAC channels. We
report on three siblings from one kindred with a clinical syndrome of
immunodeficiency, hepatosplenomegaly, autoimmune hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia, muscular hypotonia, and defective enamel dentition. Two of
these patients have a homozygous nonsense mutation in STIM1 that abrogates
expression of STIM1 and Ca(2+) influx.

Cytogenetic studies of the parents of a girl with the DiGeorge (or
velocardiofacial) syndrome, who carried a deletion at 22q11.2, revealed an
unexpected rearrangement of both 22q11.2 regions in the unaffected father. He
carried a 22q11.2 deletion on one copy of chromosome 22 and a reciprocal 22q11.2 
duplication on the other copy of chromosome 22. Genetic compensation, which is
consistent with the normal phenotype of the father, was shown through
quantitative-expression analyses of genes located within the genetic region
associated with the DiGeorge syndrome. This finding has implications for genetic 
counseling and represents a case of genetic compensation in a human genomic
disorder.

We report a chain of 10 kidney transplantations, initiated in July 2007 by a
single altruistic donor (i.e., a donor without a designated recipient) and
coordinated over a period of 8 months by two large paired-donation registries.
These transplantations involved six transplantation centers in five states. In
the case of five of the transplantations, the donors and their coregistered
recipients underwent surgery simultaneously. In the other five cases, "bridge
donors" continued the chain as many as 5 months after the coregistered recipients
in their own pairs had received transplants. This report of a chain of paired
kidney donations, in which the transplantations were not necessarily performed
simultaneously, illustrates the potential of this strategy.

We report on three cases of meningococcal disease caused by
ciprofloxacin-resistant Neisseria meningitidis, one in North Dakota and two in
Minnesota. The cases were caused by the same serogroup B strain. To assess local 
carriage of resistant N. meningitidis, we conducted a pharyngeal-carriage survey 
and isolated the resistant strain from one asymptomatic carrier. Sequencing of
the gene encoding subunit A of DNA gyrase (gyrA) revealed a mutation associated
with fluoroquinolone resistance and suggests that the resistance was acquired by 
means of horizontal gene transfer with the commensal N. lactamica. In
susceptibility testing of invasive N. meningitidis isolates from the Active
Bacterial Core surveillance system between January 2007 and January 2008, an
additional ciprofloxacin-resistant isolate was found, in this case from
California. Ciprofloxacin-resistant N. meningitidis has emerged in North America.

Deletions in the azoospermia factor region AZFa on the human Y chromosome and,
more specifically, in the region that encompasses the ubiquitin-specific
peptidase 9, Y-linked gene USP9Y have been implicated in infertility associated
with oligospermia and azoospermia. We have characterized in detail a deletion in 
AZFa that results in an absence of USP9Y in a normospermic man and his brother
and father. The association of this large deletion with normal fertility shows
that USP9Y, hitherto considered a candidate gene for infertility and azoospermia,
does not have a key role in male reproduction. These results suggest that it may 
not be necessary to consider USP9Y when screening the Y chromosome of infertile
or subfertile men for microdeletions.

Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the
presence of a CD4 receptor and a chemokine receptor, principally chemokine
receptor 5 (CCR5). Homozygosity for a 32-bp deletion in the CCR5 allele provides 
resistance against HIV-1 acquisition. We transplanted stem cells from a donor who
was homozygous for CCR5 delta32 in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and
HIV-1 infection. The patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after
transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. This outcome
demonstrates the critical role CCR5 plays in maintaining HIV-1 infection.

Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins play a major role in regulating the
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) that induces expression of genes involved in
angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival.
Germ-line mutations in the prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 gene (PHD2) have been
reported in patients with familial erythrocytosis but not in association with
tumors. We describe a patient with erythrocytosis and recurrent paraganglioma who
carries a newly discovered PHD2 mutation. This mutation affects PHD2 function and
stabilizes HIF-alpha proteins. In addition, we demonstrate loss of heterozygosity
of PHD2 in the tumor, suggesting that PHD2 could be a tumor-suppressor gene.

Syncytial giant-cell hepatitis is a rare but severe form of hepatitis that is
associated with autoimmune diseases, drug reactions, and viral infections. We
used serologic, molecular, and immunohistochemical methods to search for an
infectious cause in a case of syncytial giant-cell hepatitis that developed in a 
liver-transplant recipient who had latent infection with variant B of human
herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6B) and who had received the organ from a donor with variant A
latent infection (HHV-6A). At the onset of the disease, the detection of HHV-6A
(but not HHV-6B) DNA in plasma, in affected liver tissue, and in single
micromanipulated syncytial giant cells with the use of two different
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays indicated the presence of active HHV-6A
infection in the patient. Expression of the HHV-6A-specific early protein,
p41/38, but not of the HHV-6B-specific late protein, p101, was demonstrated only 
in liver syncytial giant cells in the absence of other infectious pathogens. The 
same markers of HHV-6A active infection were documented in serial follow-up
samples from the patient and disappeared only at the resolution of syncytial
giant-cell hepatitis. Neither HHV-6B DNA nor late protein was identified in the
same follow-up samples from the patient. Thus, HHV-6A may be a cause of syncytial
giant-cell hepatitis.

We developed an in vitro method for isolating and expanding autologous CD4+
T-cell clones with specificity for the melanoma-associated antigen NY-ESO-1. We
infused these cells into a patient with refractory metastatic melanoma who had
not undergone any previous conditioning or cytokine treatment. We show that the
transferred CD4+ T cells mediated a durable clinical remission and led to
endogenous responses against melanoma antigens other than NY-ESO-1.

We describe three unrelated girls who had an immunodeficiency disease with
granulomas in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. All three girls
had severe complications after viral infections, including B-cell lymphoma
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Other findings were
hypogammaglobulinemia, a diminished number of T and B cells, and sparse thymic
tissue on ultrasonography. Molecular analysis revealed that the patients were
compound heterozygotes for mutations in recombination activating gene 1 or 2
(RAG1 or RAG2). In each case, both parents were heterozygous carriers of a RAG
mutation. The mutations were associated with reduced function of RAG in vitro (3 
to 30% of normal activity). The parents and one sibling in the three families
were healthy.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a potentially lethal
disease characterized by adrenergically mediated ventricular arrhythmias
manifested especially in children and teenagers. Beta-blockers are the
cornerstone of therapy, but some patients do not have a complete response to this
therapy and receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Given the
nature of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, ICD shocks may
trigger new arrhythmias, leading to the administration of multiple shocks. We
describe the long-term efficacy of surgical left cardiac sympathetic denervation 
in three young adults with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,
all of whom had symptoms before the procedure and were symptom-free afterward.

BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to determine whether oversulfated chondroitin
sulfate (OSCS), a compound contaminating heparin supplies worldwide, is the cause
of the severe anaphylactoid reactions that have occurred after intravenous
heparin administration in the United States and Germany.
METHODS: Heparin procured from the Food and Drug Administration, consisting of
suspect lots of heparin associated with the clinical events as well as control
lots of heparin, were screened in a blinded fashion both for the presence of OSCS
and for any biologic activity that could potentially link the contaminant to the 
observed clinical adverse events. In vitro assays for the activation of the
contact system and the complement cascade were performed. In addition, the
ability of OSCS to recapitulate key clinical manifestations in vivo was tested in
swine.
RESULTS: The OSCS found in contaminated lots of unfractionated heparin, as well
as a synthetically generated OSCS reference standard, directly activated the
kinin-kallikrein pathway in human plasma, which can lead to the generation of
bradykinin, a potent vasoactive mediator. In addition, OSCS induced generation of
C3a and C5a, potent anaphylatoxins derived from complement proteins. Activation
of these two pathways was unexpectedly linked and dependent on fluid-phase
activation of factor XII. Screening of plasma samples from various species
indicated that swine and humans are sensitive to the effects of OSCS in a similar
manner. OSCS-containing heparin and synthetically derived OSCS induced
hypotension associated with kallikrein activation when administered by
intravenous infusion in swine.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a scientific rationale for a potential biologic 
link between the presence of OSCS in suspect lots of heparin and the observed
clinical adverse events. An assay to assess the amidolytic activity of kallikrein
can supplement analytic tests to protect the heparin supply chain by screening
for OSCS and other highly sulfated polysaccharide contaminants of heparin that
can activate the contact system.

The glomerular microvasculature is particularly susceptible to injury in
thrombotic microangiopathy, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear. 
We report the cases of six patients who were treated with bevacizumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 
in whom glomerular disease characteristic of thrombotic microangiopathy
developed. To show that local reduction of VEGF within the kidney is sufficient
to trigger the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy, we used conditional
gene targeting to delete VEGF from renal podocytes in adult mice; this resulted
in a profound thrombotic glomerular injury. These observations provide evidence
that glomerular injury in patients who are treated with bevacizumab is probably
due to direct targeting of VEGF by antiangiogenic therapy.

Gonadotropin-dependent, or central, precocious puberty is caused by early
maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In girls, this condition
is most often idiopathic. Recently, a G protein-coupled receptor, GPR54, and its 
ligand, kisspeptin, were described as an excitatory neuroregulator system for the
secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In this study, we have
identified an autosomal dominant GPR54 mutation--the substitution of proline for 
arginine at codon 386 (Arg386Pro)--in an adopted girl with idiopathic central
precocious puberty (whose biologic family was not available for genetic studies).
In vitro studies have shown that this mutation leads to prolonged activation of
intracellular signaling pathways in response to kisspeptin. The Arg386Pro mutant 
appears to be associated with central precocious puberty.

Complete hematopoietic chimerism and tolerance of a liver allograft from a
deceased male donor developed in a 9-year-old girl, with no evidence of
graft-versus-host disease 17 months after transplantation. The tolerance was
preceded by a period of severe hemolysis, reflecting partial chimerism that was
refractory to standard therapies. The hemolysis resolved after the gradual
withdrawal of all immunosuppressive therapy.

We describe a recipient of combined kidney and hematopoietic-cell transplants
from an HLA-matched donor. A post-transplantation conditioning regimen of total
lymphoid irradiation and antithymocyte globulin allowed engraftment of the
donor's hematopoietic cells. The patient had persistent mixed chimerism, and the 
function of the kidney allograft has been normal for more than 28 months since
discontinuation of all immunosuppressive drugs. Adverse events requiring
hospitalization were limited to a 2-day episode of fever with neutropenia. The
patient has had neither rejection episodes nor clinical manifestations of
graft-versus-host disease.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) alpha, which has three isoforms, is central to the
continuous balancing of the supply and demand of oxygen throughout the body.
HIF-alpha is a transcription factor that modulates a wide range of processes,
including erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and cellular metabolism. We describe a
family with erythrocytosis and a mutation in the HIF2A gene, which encodes the
HIF-2alpha protein. Our functional studies indicate that this mutation leads to
stabilization of the HIF-2alpha protein and suggest that wild-type HIF-2alpha
regulates erythropoietin production in adults.

BACKGROUND: We performed the first human partial face allograft on November 27,
2005. Here we report outcomes up to 18 months after transplantation.
METHODS: The postsurgical induction immunosuppression protocol included
thymoglobulins combined with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone.
Donor hematopoietic stem cells were infused on postoperative days 4 and 11.
Sequential biopsy specimens were taken from a sentinel skin graft, the facial
skin, and the oral mucosa. Functional progress was assessed by tests of sensory
and motor function performed monthly. Psychological support was provided before
and after transplantation.
RESULTS: Sensitivity to light touch, as assessed with the use of static
monofilaments, and sensitivity to heat and cold had returned to normal at 6
months after transplantation. Motor recovery was slower, and labial contact
allowing complete mouth closure was achieved at 10 months. Psychological
acceptance of the graft progressed as function improved. Rejection episodes
occurred on days 18 and 214 after transplantation and were reversed. A decrease
in inulin clearance led to a change in immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus 
to sirolimus at 14 months. Extracorporeal photochemotherapy was introduced at 10 
months to prevent recurrence of rejection. There have been no subsequent
rejection episodes. At 18 months, the patient is satisfied with the aesthetic
result.
CONCLUSIONS: In this patient who underwent the first partial face
transplantation, the functional and aesthetic results 18 months after
transplantation are satisfactory.

An out-of-body experience was repeatedly elicited during stimulation of the
posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus on the right side in a patient in
whom electrodes had been implanted to suppress tinnitus. Positron-emission
tomographic scanning showed brain activation at the temporoparietal
junction--more specifically, at the angular-supramarginal gyrus junction and the 
superior temporal gyrus-sulcus on the right side. Activation was also noted at
the right precuneus and posterior thalamus, extending into the superior vermis.
We suggest that activation of these regions is the neural correlate of the
disembodiment that is part of the out-of-body experience.

Selective luteinizing hormone deficiency due to mutations in the luteinizing
hormone beta-subunit gene (LHB) is a rare cause of hypogonadism. We describe the 
clinical features of a consanguineous family in which three siblings, two men and
one woman, had hypogonadism related to isolated luteinizing hormone deficiency.
These subjects have a newly discovered homozygous mutation of a 5' splice site in
LHB: IVS2+1G-->C. This mutation disrupts the splicing of messenger RNA (mRNA),
generating a gross abnormality in the processing of the luteinizing hormone
beta-subunit mRNA, which abrogates the secretion of luteinizing hormone. We also 
determined that the female phenotype of this LHB mutation is characterized by
normal pubertal development, secondary amenorrhea, and infertility.

Mevalonic aciduria is a rare, inborn error of isoprene biosynthesis characterized
by severe, periodic attacks of fever and inflammation, developmental delay,
ataxia, and dysmorphic features. This autosomal recessive disease is caused by a 
mutation in the mevalonate kinase gene that severely reduces mevalonate kinase
activity. A 3-year-old boy with mevalonic aciduria whose condition had failed to 
improve with antiinflammatory treatment underwent allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation from an HLA-identical sister who was a heterozygous carrier of
the mutant gene. We observed sustained remission of febrile attacks and
inflammation during a 15-month follow-up period.

Entecavir, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment 
of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is not believed to inhibit
replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) at clinically relevant
doses. We observed that entecavir led to a consistent 1-log(10) decrease in HIV-1
RNA in three persons with HIV-1 and HBV coinfection, and we obtained supportive
in vitro evidence that entecavir is a potent partial inhibitor of HIV-1
replication. Detailed analysis showed that in one of these patients, entecavir
monotherapy led to an accumulation of HIV-1 variants with the
lamivudine-resistant mutation, M184V. In vitro experiments showed that M184V
confers resistance to entecavir. Until more is known about HIV-1-resistance
patterns and their selection by entecavir, caution is needed with the use of
entecavir in persons with HIV-1 and HBV coinfection who are not receiving fully
suppressive antiretroviral regimens.

Bartonella species cause serious human infections globally, including bacillary
angiomatosis, Oroya fever, trench fever, and endocarditis. We describe a patient 
who had fever and splenomegaly after traveling to Peru and also had bacteremia
from an organism that resembled Bartonella bacilliformis, the causative agent of 
Oroya fever, which is endemic to Peru. However, genetic analyses revealed that
this fastidious bacterium represented a previously uncultured and unnamed
bartonella species, closely related to B. clarridgeiae and more distantly related
to B. bacilliformis. We characterized this isolate, including its ability to
cause fever and sustained bacteremia in a rhesus macaque. The route of infection 
and burden of human disease associated with this newly described pathogen are
currently unknown.

We report on a newborn girl with microcephaly, abnormal brain development, optic 
atrophy and hypoplasia, persistent lactic acidemia, and a mildly elevated plasma 
concentration of very-long-chain fatty acids. We found a defect of the fission of
both mitochondria and peroxisomes, as well as a heterozygous, dominant-negative
mutation in the dynamin-like protein 1 gene (DLP1). The DLP1 protein has
previously been implicated, in vitro, in the fission of both these organelles.
Overexpression of the mutant DLP1 in control cells reproduced the fission defect.
Our findings are representative of a class of disease characterized by defects in
both mitochondria and peroxisomes.

Disrupted binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to the mutated promoter region 
of the mannosyl transferase-encoding gene PIGM causes inherited
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) deficiency characterized by splanchnic vein
thrombosis and epilepsy. We show that this results in histone hypoacetylation at 
the promoter of PIGM. The histone deacetylase inhibitor butyrate increases PIGM
transcription and surface GPI expression in vitro as well as in vivo through
enhanced histone acetylation in an Sp1-dependent manner. More important, the drug
caused complete cessation of intractable seizures in a child with inherited GPI
deficiency.

Most cases of male prepubertal gynecomastia are classified as idiopathic. We
investigated possible causes of gynecomastia in three prepubertal boys who were
otherwise healthy and had normal serum concentrations of endogenous steroids. In 
all three boys, gynecomastia coincided with the topical application of products
that contained lavender and tea tree oils. Gynecomastia resolved in each patient 
shortly after the use of products containing these oils was discontinued.
Furthermore, studies in human cell lines indicated that the two oils had
estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities. We conclude that repeated topical
exposure to lavender and tea tree oils probably caused prepubertal gynecomastia
in these boys.

Classic osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder associated with
osteoporosis and bone fragility, is caused by mutations in the genes for type I
collagen. A recessive form of the disorder has long been suspected. Since the
loss of cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), which is required for
post-translational prolyl 3-hydroxylation of collagen, causes severe osteoporosis
in mice, we investigated whether CRTAP deficiency is associated with recessive
osteogenesis imperfecta. Three of 10 children with lethal or severe osteogenesis 
imperfecta, who did not have a primary collagen defect yet had excess
post-translational modification of collagen, were found to have a recessive
condition resulting in CRTAP deficiency, suggesting that prolyl 3-hydroxylation
of type I collagen is important for bone formation.

BACKGROUND: Neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3) is expressed in endocrine progenitor cells and
is required for endocrine-cell development in the pancreas and intestine. The
NEUROG3 gene (NEUROG3) is therefore a candidate for the cause of a newly
discovered autosomal recessive disorder characterized by generalized
malabsorption and a paucity of enteroendocrine cells.
METHODS: We screened genomic DNA from three unrelated patients with sparse
enteroendocrine cells for mutations of NEUROG3. We then tested the ability of the
observed mutations to alter NEUROG3 function, using in vitro and in vivo assays.
RESULTS: The patients had few intestinal enteroendocrine cells positive for
chromogranin A, but they had normal numbers of Paneth's, goblet, and absorptive
cells. We identified two homozygous mutations in NEUROG3, both of which rendered 
the NEUROG3 protein unable to activate NEUROD1, a downstream target of NEUROG3,
and compromised the ability of NEUROG3 to bind to an E-box element in the NEUROD1
promoter. The injection of wild-type but not mutant NEUROG3 messenger RNA into
xenopus embryos induced NEUROD1 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: A newly discovered disorder characterized by malabsorptive diarrhea 
and a lack of intestinal enteroendocrine cells is caused by loss-of-function
mutations in NEUROG3.

BACKGROUND: In December 2003 and April 2005, signs and symptoms suggestive of
infection developed in two groups of recipients of solid-organ transplants. Each 
cluster was investigated because diagnostic evaluations were unrevealing, and in 
each a common donor was recognized.
METHODS: We examined clinical specimens from the two donors and eight recipients,
using viral culture, electron microscopy, serologic testing, molecular analysis, 
and histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining to identify a
cause. Epidemiologic investigations, including interviews, environmental
assessments, and medical-record reviews, were performed to characterize clinical 
courses and to determine the cause of the illnesses.
RESULTS: Laboratory testing revealed lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in
all the recipients, with a single, unique strain of LCMV identified in each
cluster. In both investigations, LCMV could not be detected in the organ donor.
In the 2005 cluster, the donor had had contact in her home with a pet hamster
infected with an LCMV strain identical to that detected in the organ recipients; 
no source of LCMV infection was found in the 2003 cluster. The transplant
recipients had abdominal pain, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, elevated 
aminotransferase levels, coagulopathy, graft dysfunction, and either fever or
leukocytosis within three weeks after transplantation. Diarrhea, peri-incisional 
rash, renal failure, and seizures were variably present. Seven of the eight
recipients died, 9 to 76 days after transplantation. One recipient, who received 
ribavirin and reduced levels of immunosuppressive therapy, survived.
CONCLUSIONS: We document two clusters of LCMV infection transmitted through organ
transplantation.

A four-month-old boy with primary immunodeficiency was found to have a homozygous
germ-line mutation of the gene encoding the CD3zeta subunit of the T-cell
receptor-CD3 complex. CD3zeta is necessary for the development and function of T 
cells. Some of the patient's T cells had low levels of the T-cell receptor-CD3
complex and carried the Q70X mutation in both alleles of CD3zeta, whereas other T
cells had normal levels of the complex and bore the Q70X mutation on only one
allele of CD3zeta, plus one of three heterozygous somatic mutations of CD3zeta on
the other allele, allowing expression of poorly functional T-cell receptor-CD3
complexes.

    N Engl J Med. 2006 May 4;354(18):1874-7.

BACKGROUND: The CD19 protein forms a complex with CD21, CD81, and CD225 in the
membrane of mature B cells. Together with the B-cell antigen receptor, this
complex signals the B cell to decrease its threshold for activation by the
antigen.
METHODS: We evaluated four patients from two unrelated families who had increased
susceptibility to infection, hypogammaglobulinemia, and normal numbers of mature 
B cells in blood. We found a mutation in the CD19 gene in all four patients. The 
CD19 gene in the patients and their first-degree relatives was sequenced, and
flow-cytometric immunophenotyping of B cells, immunohistochemical staining of
lymphoid tissues, and DNA and messenger RNA analysis were performed. B-cell
responses on the triggering of the B-cell receptor were investigated by in vitro 
stimulation; the antibody response after vaccination with rabies vaccine was also
studied.
RESULTS: All four patients had homozygous mutations in the CD19 gene. Levels of
CD19 were undetectable in one patient and substantially decreased in the other
three. Levels of CD21 were decreased, whereas levels of CD81 and CD225 were
normal, in all four patients. The composition of the precursor B-cell compartment
in bone marrow and the total numbers of B cells in blood were normal. However,
the numbers of CD27+ memory B cells and CD5+ B cells were decreased. Secondary
follicles in lymphoid tissues were small to normal in size and had a normal
cellular composition. The few B cells that showed molecular signs of switching
from one immunoglobulin class to another contained V(H)-C(alpha) and
V(H)-C(gamma) transcripts with somatic mutations. The response of the patients' B
cells to in vitro stimulation through the B-cell receptor was impaired, and in
all four patients, the antibody response to rabies vaccination was poor.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of the CD19 gene causes a type of hypogammaglobulinemia in 
which the response of mature B cells to antigenic stimulation is defective.

Influenza A (H5N1) virus with an amino acid substitution in neuraminidase
conferring high-level resistance to oseltamivir was isolated from two of eight
Vietnamese patients during oseltamivir treatment. Both patients died of influenza
A (H5N1) virus infection, despite early initiation of treatment in one patient.
Surviving patients had rapid declines in the viral load to undetectable levels
during treatment. These observations suggest that resistance can emerge during
the currently recommended regimen of oseltamivir therapy and may be associated
with clinical deterioration and that the strategy for the treatment of influenza 
A (H5N1) virus infection should include additional antiviral agents.

Endometritis and toxic shock syndrome associated with Clostridium sordellii have 
previously been reported after childbirth and, in one case, after medical
abortion. We describe four deaths due to endometritis and toxic shock syndrome
associated with C. sordellii that occurred within one week after medically
induced abortions. Clinical findings included tachycardia, hypotension, edema,
hemoconcentration, profound leukocytosis, and absence of fever. These cases
indicate the need for physician awareness of this syndrome and for further study 
of its association with medical abortion.

Glutamine synthetase plays a major role in ammonia detoxification, interorgan
nitrogen flux, acid-base homeostasis, and cell signaling. We report on two
unrelated newborns who had congenital human glutamine synthetase deficiency with 
severe brain malformations resulting in multiorgan failure and neonatal death.
Glutamine was largely absent from their serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid.
Each infant had a homozygous mutation in the glutamine synthetase gene (R324C and
R341C). Studies that used immortalized lymphocytes expressing R324C glutamine
synthetase (R324C-GS) and COS7 cells expressing R341C-GS suggest that these
mutations are associated with reduced glutamine synthetase activity.

The Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) locus, at 7q11.23, is prone to recurrent
chromosomal rearrangements, including the microdeletion that causes WBS, a
multisystem condition with characteristic cardiovascular, cognitive, and
behavioral features. It is hypothesized that reciprocal duplications of the WBS
interval should also occur, and here we present such a case description. The most
striking phenotype was a severe delay in expressive speech, in contrast to the
normal articulation and fluent expressive language observed in persons with WBS. 
Our results suggest that specific genes at 7q11.23 are exquisitely sensitive to
dosage alterations that can influence human language and visuospatial
capabilities.

Staphylococcus aureus has increasingly been recognized as a cause of severe
invasive illness. We describe three children who died at our institution after
rapidly progressive clinical deterioration from this infection, with necrotizing 
pneumonia and multiple-organ-system involvement. The identification of bilateral 
adrenal hemorrhage at autopsy was characteristic of the Waterhouse-Friderichsen
syndrome, a constellation of findings usually associated with fulminant
meningococcemia. The close genetic relationship among the three responsible
isolates of S. aureus, one susceptible to methicillin and two resistant to
methicillin, underscores the close relationship between virulent
methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates
now circulating in the community.

Juvenile Paget's disease, a genetic bone disease characterized by accelerated
bone turnover, results from inactivating mutations in the gene encoding
osteoprotegerin--a key regulator of osteoclastogenesis. The effects of
recombinant osteoprotegerin were investigated in two adult siblings with juvenile
Paget's disease. Bone resorption (assessed by N-telopeptide excretion) was
suppressed by once-weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.3 to 0.4 mg per kilogram of
body weight. After 15 months of treatment, radial bone mass increased in one
patient by 9 percent and in the other by 30 percent, skeletal bisphosphonate
retention decreased by 37 percent and 55 percent, respectively, and there was
radiographic improvement. Apart from mild hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, no
apparent adverse events occurred.

We describe six patients (five women and one man; median age, 47 years; range, 39
to 54) with postprandial symptoms of neuroglycopenia owing to endogenous
hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Except for 
equivocal evidence in one patient, there was no radiologic evidence of
insulinoma. Selective arterial calcium-stimulation tests, positive in each
patient, were used to guide partial pancreatectomy. Nesidioblastosis was
identified in resected specimens from each patient, and multiple insulinomas were
identified in one. Hypoglycemic symptoms diminished postoperatively. We speculate
that hyperfunction of pancreatic islets did not lead to obesity but that
beta-cell trophic factors may have increased as a result of gastric bypass.

We describe an immunocompetent 61-year-old woman who was negative for human
immunodeficiency virus and who had recurrent human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)
infection associated with a relapsing systemic inflammatory syndrome
characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, edema, arthrosynovitis,
and rash. Kaposi's sarcoma developed 10 months after the initial clinical
presentation. A correlation was documented between the recurrent clinical
manifestations and the HHV-8 load in plasma and peripheral-blood mononuclear
cells. Histologic examination of an enlarged lymph node heavily infected with
HHV-8 revealed an atypical lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by
paracortical hyperplasia and collapsed primary and secondary follicles.

We report the survival of a 15-year-old girl in whom clinical rabies developed
one month after she was bitten by a bat. Treatment included induction of coma
while a native immune response matured; rabies vaccine was not administered. The 
patient was treated with ketamine, midazolam, ribavirin, and amantadine. Probable
drug-related toxic effects included hemolysis, pancreatitis, acidosis, and
hepatotoxicity. Lumbar puncture after eight days showed an increased level of
rabies antibody, and sedation was tapered. Paresis and sensory denervation then
resolved. The patient was removed from isolation after 31 days and discharged to 
her home after 76 days. At nearly five months after her initial hospitalization, 
she was alert and communicative, but with choreoathetosis, dysarthria, and an
unsteady gait.

The prior diagnosis of fatal astrocytoma in a 60-year-old man with Crohn's
disease treated with natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against alpha4 integrins,
was reclassified as JC virus-related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML). Analysis of frozen serum samples showed that JC virus DNA had appeared in 
the serum three months after the initiation of open-label natalizumab monotherapy
and two months before the appearance of symptomatic PML. There was staining of
the brain lesion for polyomavirus. This case report, along with two others,
suggests that anti-alpha4-integrin therapy can result in JC virus-induced PML.

A 46-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis died from
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) after having received 37 doses
of natalizumab (300 mg every four weeks) as part of a clinical trial of
natalizumab and interferon beta-1a. PML was diagnosed on the basis of the finding
of JC viral DNA in cerebrospinal fluid on polymerase-chain-reaction assay and was
confirmed at autopsy. Nearly every tissue section from bilateral cerebral
hemispheres contained either macroscopic or microscopic PML lesions. There was
extensive tissue destruction and cavitation in the left frontoparietal area,
large numbers of bizarre astrocytes, and inclusion-bearing oligodendrocytes,
which were positive for JC virus DNA on in situ hybridization.

We describe the clinical course of a patient with multiple sclerosis in whom
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic viral
infection of the central nervous system, developed during treatment with
interferon beta-1a and a selective adhesion-molecule blocker, natalizumab. The
first PML lesion apparent on magnetic resonance imaging was indistinguishable
from a multiple sclerosis lesion. Despite treatment with corticosteroids,
cidofovir, and intravenous immune globulin, PML progressed rapidly, rendering the
patient quadriparetic, globally aphasic, and minimally responsive. Three months
after natalizumab therapy was discontinued, changes consistent with an
immune-reconstitution inflammatory syndrome developed. The patient was treated
with systemic cytarabine, and two months later, his condition had improved.

Monozygotic 24-year-old twins presented with discordant ovarian function. One had
had premature ovarian failure at the age of 14 years, whereas her sister had
normal ovaries and three naturally conceived children. After unsuccessful
egg-donation therapy, the sterile twin received a transplant of ovarian cortical 
tissue from her sister by means of a minilaparotomy. Within three months after
transplantation, the recipient's cycles resumed and serum gonadotropin levels
fell to the normal range. During the second cycle, she conceived, and her
pregnancy progressed uneventfully. At 38 weeks' gestation, she delivered a
healthy-appearing female infant.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common 
cause of hyponatremia. We describe two infants whose clinical and laboratory
evaluations were consistent with the presence of SIADH, yet who had undetectable 
arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels. We hypothesized that they had gain-of-function
mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R). DNA sequencing of each patient's 
V2R gene (AVPR2) identified missense mutations in both, with resultant changes in
codon 137 from arginine to cysteine or leucine. These novel mutations cause
constitutive activation of the receptor and are the likely cause of the patients'
SIADH-like clinical picture, which we have termed "nephrogenic syndrome of
inappropriate antidiuresis."

Five adult siblings presented with autosomal recessive sensorineural hearing
loss: two had high-frequency loss, whereas the other three had severe-to-profound
loss affecting all frequencies. Genetic evaluation revealed that a homozygous
mutation in CDH23 (which encodes cadherin 23) caused the hearing loss in all five
siblings and that a heterozygous, hypofunctional variant (V586M) in
plasma-membrane calcium pump PMCA2, which is encoded by ATP2B2, was associated
with increased loss in the three severely affected siblings. V586M was detected
in two unrelated persons with increased sensorineural hearing loss, in the other 
caused by a mutation in MYO6 (which encodes myosin VI) in one and by noise
exposure, suggesting that this variant may modify the severity of sensorineural
hearing loss caused by a variety of factors.

Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been
identified in specimens from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have a 
response to anilinoquinazoline EGFR inhibitors. Despite the dramatic responses to
such inhibitors, most patients ultimately have a relapse. The mechanism of the
drug resistance is unknown. Here we report the case of a patient with
EGFR-mutant, gefitinib-responsive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who had a 
relapse after two years of complete remission during treatment with gefitinib.
The DNA sequence of the EGFR gene in his tumor biopsy specimen at relapse
revealed the presence of a second point mutation, resulting in
threonine-to-methionine amino acid change at position 790 of EGFR. Structural
modeling and biochemical studies showed that this second mutation led to
gefitinib resistance.

In southern Vietnam, a four-year-old boy presented with severe diarrhea, followed
by seizures, coma, and death. The cerebrospinal fluid contained 1 white cell per 
cubic millimeter, normal glucose levels, and increased levels of protein (0.81 g 
per liter). The diagnosis of avian influenza A (H5N1) was established by
isolation of the virus from cerebrospinal fluid, fecal, throat, and serum
specimens. The patient's nine-year-old sister had died from a similar syndrome
two weeks earlier. In both siblings, the clinical diagnosis was acute
encephalitis. Neither patient had respiratory symptoms at presentation. These
cases suggest that the spectrum of influenza H5N1 is wider than previously
thought.

BACKGROUND: During 2004, a highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
caused poultry disease in eight Asian countries and infected at least 44 persons,
killing 32; most of these persons had had close contact with poultry. No evidence
of efficient person-to-person transmission has yet been reported. We investigated
possible person-to-person transmission in a family cluster of the disease in
Thailand.
METHODS: For each of the three involved patients, we reviewed the circumstances
and timing of exposures to poultry and to other ill persons. Field teams isolated
and treated the surviving patient, instituted active surveillance for disease and
prophylaxis among exposed contacts, and culled the remaining poultry surrounding 
the affected village. Specimens from family members were tested by viral culture,
microneutralization serologic analysis, immunohistochemical assay,
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and genetic
sequencing.
RESULTS: The index patient became ill three to four days after her last exposure 
to dying household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her 
in the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from pneumonia
after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The aunt also
provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever five days after the mother first
had fever, followed by pneumonia seven days later. Autopsy tissue from the mother
and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were positive for influenza A
(H5N1) by RT-PCR. No additional chains of transmission were identified, and
sequencing of the viral genes identified no change in the receptor-binding site
of hemagglutinin or other key features of the virus. The sequences of all eight
viral gene segments clustered closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian
isolates in Thailand.
CONCLUSIONS: Disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from
person-to-person transmission of this lethal avian influenzavirus during
unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient.

Life-threatening opioid intoxication developed in a patient after he was given
small doses of codeine for the treatment of a cough associated with bilateral
pneumonia. Codeine is bioactivated by CYP2D6 into morphine, which then undergoes 
further glucuronidation. CYP2D6 genotyping showed that the patient had three or
more functional alleles, a finding consistent with ultrarapid metabolism of
codeine. We attribute the toxicity to this genotype, in combination with
inhibition of CYP3A4 activity by other medications and a transient reduction in
renal function.

A 30-year-old man who presented with delayed puberty and infertility was found to
have hypogonadism associated with an absence of circulating luteinizing hormone. 
The patient had a homozygous missense mutation in the gene that encodes the beta 
subunit of luteinizing hormone (Gly36Asp), a mutation that disrupted a vital
cystine knot motif and abrogated the heterodimerization and secretion of
luteinizing hormone. Treatment with human chorionic gonadotropin increased
circulating testosterone, promoted virilization, and was associated with the
appearance of normal spermatozoa in low concentrations. This case illustrates the
important physiological role that luteinizing hormone plays in male sexual
maturation and fertility.

We describe a family in whom three members affected by acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) had an identical, 212delC mutation in CEBPA, the gene encoding the
granulocytic differentiation factor C/EBPalpha. Unaffected family members did not
have this mutation. Latent periods of 10, 18, and 30 years elapsed before the
onset of overt leukemia in the three patients. One of them had a second CEBPA
mutation, but only at the time of diagnosis. All three patients are currently
well, with no abnormalities in the bone marrow. CEBPA mutation is apparently the 
primary event in the development of AML in this family.

Although most components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus are encoded
by nuclear genes, all known molecular defects associated with impaired
mitochondrial translation are due to mutations in mitochondrial DNA. We
investigated two siblings with a severe defect in mitochondrial translation,
reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA)-encoded subunits, and progressive hepatoencephalopathy. We mapped the
defective gene to a region on chromosome 3q containing elongation factor G1
(EFG1), which encodes a mitochondrial translation factor. Sequencing of EFG1
revealed a mutation affecting a conserved residue of the guanosine triphosphate
(GTP)-binding domain. These results define a new class of gene defects underlying
disorders of oxidative phosphorylation.

was normal. Her paternal allele had not only the expected sickle-trait mutation, 
betaGlu6Val, but also a second, charge-neutral mutation, betaLeu68Phe. Analysis
of the patient's hemoglobin revealed that the double-mutant protein, which we
called "hemoglobin Jamaica Plain," had severely reduced oxygen affinity.
Structural modeling suggested destabilization of the oxy conformation as a
molecular mechanism for sickling in a heterozygote at an ambient partial pressure
of oxygen.

A 27-year-old man with the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and a
large-B-cell lymphoma had heterozygous mutations in the Fas and perforin (Prf1)
genes. The Fas mutation was inherited from his healthy father and was also
carried by his healthy brother, whereas the Prf1 mutation was inherited from his 
healthy mother. The combined effect of the two mutant genes may have contributed 
to the development of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome and lymphoma in
this patient.

WNT4, a secreted protein that suppresses male sexual differentiation, is thought 
to repress the biosynthesis of gonadal androgen in female mammals. An 18-year-old
woman presented with primary amenorrhea and an absence of müllerian-derived
structures, unilateral renal agenesis, and clinical signs of androgen excess--a
phenotype resembling the Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome and remarkably
similar to that of female Wnt4-knockout mice. A genetic evaluation revealed a
loss-of-function mutation in the WNT4 gene. WNT4 appears to be important in the
development and maintenance of the female phenotype in women, by means of the
regulation of müllerian-duct formation and control of ovarian steroidogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (also known as alpha
chain disease) is a form of lymphoma that arises in small intestinal
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and is associated with the expression of
a monotypic truncated immunoglobulin alpha heavy chain without an associated
light chain. Early-stage disease responds to antibiotics, suggesting a bacterial 
origin. We attempted to identify a causative agent.
METHODS: We performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing,
fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemical studies on
intestinal-biopsy specimens from a series of patients with immunoproliferative
small intestinal disease.
RESULTS: Analysis of frozen intestinal tissue obtained from an index patient with
immunoproliferative small intestinal disease who had a dramatic response to
antibiotics revealed the presence of Campylobacter jejuni. A follow-up
retrospective analysis of archival intestinal-biopsy specimens disclosed
campylobacter species in four of six additional patients with immunoproliferative
small intestinal disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that campylobacter and immunoproliferative
small intestinal disease are associated and that C. jejuni should be added to the
growing list of human pathogens responsible for immunoproliferative states.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 10 percent of infants with intrauterine growth
retardation remain small, and the causes of their growth deficits are often
unclear. We postulated that mutations in the gene for the insulin-like growth
factor I receptor (IGF-IR) might underlie some cases of prenatal and postnatal
growth failure.
METHODS: We screened two groups of children for abnormalities in the IGF-IR gene.
In one group of 42 patients with unexplained intrauterine growth retardation and 
subsequent short stature, we used single-strand conformation polymorphism
analysis, followed by direct DNA sequencing of any abnormalities found. A second 
cohort consisted of 50 children with short stature who had elevated circulating
IGF-I concentrations. Complete sequencing of the IGF-IR gene was performed with
DNA from nine children. We also studied a control group of 43 children with
normal birth weights.
RESULTS: In the first cohort, we identified one girl who was a compound
heterozygote for point mutations in exon 2 of the IGF-IR gene that altered the
amino acid sequence to Arg108Gln in one allele and Lys115Asn in the other.
Fibroblasts cultured from the patient had decreased IGF-I-receptor function, as
compared with that in control fibroblasts. No such mutations were found in the 43
controls. In the second group, we identified one boy with a nonsense mutation
(Arg59stop) that reduced the number of IGF-I receptors on fibroblasts. Both
children had intrauterine growth retardation and poor postnatal growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the IGF-IR gene that lead to abnormalities in the
function or number of IGF-I receptors may also retard intrauterine and subsequent
growth in humans.

BACKGROUND: In August 2002, fever and mental-status changes developed in
recipients of organs from a common donor. Transmission of West Nile virus through
organ transplantation was suspected.
METHODS: We reviewed medical records, conducted interviews, and collected blood
and tissue samples for testing with a variety of assays. Persons who donated
blood to the organ donor and associated blood components were identified and
tested for West Nile virus.
RESULTS: We identified West Nile virus infection in the organ donor and in all
four organ recipients. Encephalitis developed in three of the organ recipients,
and febrile illness developed in one. Three recipients became seropositive for
West Nile virus IgM antibody; the fourth recipient had brain tissue that was
positive for West Nile virus by isolation and nucleic acid and antigen assays.
Serum specimens obtained from the organ donor before and immediately after blood 
transfusions showed no evidence of West Nile virus; however, serum and plasma
samples obtained at the time of organ recovery were positive on viral nucleic
acid testing and viral culture. The organ donor had received blood transfusions
from 63 donors. A review of blood donors and follow-up testing identified one
donor who had viremia at the time of donation and who became seropositive for
West Nile virus IgM antibodies during the next two months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation of this cluster documents the transmission of West
Nile virus by organ transplantation. Organ recipients receiving immunosuppressive
drugs may be at high risk for severe disease after West Nile virus infection.
Blood transfusion was the probable source of the West Nile virus viremia in the
organ donor.

Estrogen excess associated with novel gain-of-function mutations affecting the
aromatase gene.

SE.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Illinois at Chicago,
Chicago, USA.

BACKGROUND: Gynecomastia of prepubertal onset may result from increased estrogen 
owing to excessive aromatase activity in extraglandular tissues. A gene in
chromosome 15q21.2 encodes aromatase, the key enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis.
Several physiologic tissue-specific promoters regulate the expression of
aromatase, giving rise to messenger RNA (mRNA) species with an identical coding
region but tissue-specific 5'-untranslated regions in placenta, gonads, brain,
fat, and skin.
METHODS: We studied skin, fat, and blood samples from a 36-year-old man, his
7-year-old son, and an unrelated 17-year-old boy with severe gynecomastia of
prepubertal onset and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism caused by elevated estrogen
levels.
RESULTS: Aromatase activity and mRNA levels in fat and skin and whole-body
aromatization of androstenedione were severely elevated. Treatment with an
aromatase inhibitor decreased serum estrogen levels and normalized gonadotropin
and testosterone levels. The 5'-untranslated regions of aromatase mRNA contained 
the same sequence (FLJ) in the father and son and another sequence (TMOD3) in the
unrelated boy; neither sequence was found in control subjects. These
5'-untranslated regions normally make up the first exons of two ubiquitously
expressed genes clustered in chromosome 15q21.2-3 in the following order (from
telomere to centromere): FLJ, TMOD3, and aromatase. The aromatase gene is
normally transcribed in the direction opposite to that of TMOD3 and FLJ. Two
distinct heterozygous inversions reversed the direction of the TMOD3 or FLJ
promoter in the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous inversions in chromosome 15q21.2-3, which caused the
coding region of the aromatase gene to lie adjacent to constitutively active
cryptic promoters that normally transcribe other genes, resulted in severe
estrogen excess owing to the overexpression of aromatase in many tissues.

    N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 15;347(7):527-30.

BACKGROUND: Nephropathy associated with the polyomavirus type BK (BKV)
nephropathy has emerged as a cause of allograft failure linked to
immunosuppressive regimens containing tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil. The
presence of viral inclusions, known as "decoy cells," in urine and the presence
of BKV DNA in plasma have been proposed as markers for the replication of BKV and
associated nephropathy, but data from prospective studies have been lacking.
METHODS: In a prospective, single-center study, we followed 78 renal-transplant
recipients who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy that included tacrolimus 
(37 patients) or mycophenolate mofetil (41 patients). Urine was tested for the
presence of decoy cells at routine visits. BKV DNA was measured 3, 6, and 12
months after transplantation and whenever decoy cells were detected. The viral
load in plasma was quantified with the use of a real-time
polymerase-chain-reaction method. Renal biopsy was performed if allograft
function deteriorated.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had decoy-cell shedding a median of 16 weeks after
transplantation (range, 2 to 69), 10 patients had BKV viremia at a median of 23
weeks (range, 4 to 73), and 5 had BKV nephropathy at a median of 28 weeks (range,
8 to 86). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of decoy-cell shedding,
viremia, and nephropathy were 30 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to
40 percent), 13 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 21 percent), and 8 
percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 15 percent), respectively.
Antirejection treatment, particularly with corticosteroids, was associated with
BKV replication and nephropathy. The viral load in plasma was higher in patients 
with BKV nephropathy than in those without nephropathy (P<0.001 by the
Mann-Whitney test). BKV antibodies were detected in 77 percent of the 78 patients
before transplantation, including 4 of 5 with BKV nephropathy.
CONCLUSIONS: BKV nephropathy in renal-transplant recipients represents a
secondary infection associated with rejection and its treatment in most cases and
could be monitored by measuring the viral load in plasma.

BACKGROUND: Juvenile Paget's disease, an autosomal recessive osteopathy, is
characterized by rapidly remodeling woven bone, osteopenia, fractures, and
progressive skeletal deformity. The molecular basis is not known. Osteoprotegerin
deficiency could explain juvenile Paget's disease because osteoprotegerin
suppresses bone turnover by functioning as a decoy receptor for osteoclast
differentiation factor (also called RANK ligand).
METHODS: We evaluated two apparently unrelated Navajo patients with juvenile
Paget's disease for defects in the gene encoding osteoprotegerin (TNFRSF11B)
using polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplification followed by direct sequencing
and Southern blotting of genomic DNA. Genetic markers near TNFRSF11B were
evaluated by both a PCR method that involved sequence-tagged site-content mapping
of a deletion of TNFRSF11B and PCR spanning the DNA break points.
RESULTS: Both patients had a homozygous deletion of TNFRSF11B, with identical
break points, on chromosome 8q24.2. The defect spans approximately 100 kb, but
neighboring genes are intact. We found that serum levels of osteoprotegerin and
soluble osteoclast differentiation factor were undetectable and markedly
increased, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile Paget's disease can result from osteoprotegerin deficiency 
caused by homozygous deletion of TNFRSF11B.

BACKGROUND: Germ-line truncating mutations in the E-cadherin (CDH1) gene have
been found in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. These families are
characterized by a highly penetrant susceptibility to diffuse gastric cancer with
an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, predominantly in young persons. We 
describe genetic screening, surgical management, and pathological findings in
young persons with truncating mutations in CDH1 from two unrelated families with 
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.
METHODS: Mutation-specific predictive genetic testing was performed by
polymerase-chain-reaction amplification, followed by restriction-enzyme digestion
and DNA sequencing in Family 1 and by heteroduplex analysis in Family 2. A total 
gastrectomy was performed prophylactically in five carriers of mutations who were
between 22 and 40 years old. In each case, the entire mucosa of the stomach was
extensively sampled for microscopical analysis.
RESULTS: Superficial infiltrates of malignant signet-ring cells were identified
in the surgical samples from all five persons who underwent gastrectomy. These
early diffuse gastric cancers were multifocal in three of the five cases, and in 
one person infiltrates of malignant signet-ring cells were present in 65 of the
140 tissue blocks analyzed, representing in aggregate less than 2 percent of the 
gastric mucosa.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend genetic counseling and consideration of prophylactic
gastrectomy in young, asymptomatic carriers of germ-line truncating CDH1
mutations who belong to families with highly penetrant hereditary diffuse gastric
cancer.

MN 55415-1829, USA. dzvosec@hotmail.com

BACKGROUND: 1,4-Butanediol is an industrial solvent that, when ingested, is
converted to gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a drug of abuse with depressant effects,
primarily on the central nervous system. After reports of toxic effects of
gamma-hydroxybutyrate and its resultant regulation by the federal government,
1,4-butanediol and gamma-butyrolactone, another precursor of
gamma-hydroxybutyrate and an industrial solvent, began to be marketed as dietary 
supplements. We investigated reports of toxic effects due to the ingestion of
1,4-butanediol and reviewed the related health risks.
METHODS: From June 1999 through December 1999, we identified cases of toxic
effects of 1,4-butanediol involving patients who presented to our emergency
departments with a clinical syndrome suggesting toxic effects of
gamma-hydroxybutyrate and a history of ingesting 1,4-butanediol and patients
discovered through public health officials and family members. We used gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry to measure 1,4-butanediol or its metabolite,
gamma-hydroxybutyrate, in urine, serum, or blood.
RESULTS: We identified nine episodes of toxic effects in eight patients who had
ingested 1,4-butanediol recreationally, to enhance bodybuilding, or to treat
depression or insomnia. One patient presented twice with toxic effects and had
withdrawal symptoms after her second presentation. Clinical findings and adverse 
events included vomiting, urinary and fecal incontinence, agitation,
combativeness, a labile level of consciousness, respiratory depression, and
death. No additional intoxicants were identified in six patients, including the
two who died. The doses of 1,4-butanediol ingested ranged from 5.4 to 20 g in the
patients who died and ranged from 1 to 14 g in the nonfatal cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The health risks of 1,4-butanediol are similar to those of its
counterparts, gamma-hydroxybutyrate and gamma-butyrolactone. These include acute 
toxic effects, which may be fatal, and addiction and withdrawal.

    N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec 21;343(25):1886-7.

BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids (sometimes called 
ma huang) are widely promoted and used in the United States as a means of losing 
weight and increasing energy. In the light of recently reported adverse events
related to use of these products, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
proposed limits on the dose and duration of use of such supplements. The FDA
requested an independent review of reports of adverse events related to the use
of supplements that contained ephedra alkaloids to assess causation and to
estimate the level of risk the use of these supplements poses to consumers.
METHODS: We reviewed 140 reports of adverse events related to the use of dietary 
supplements containing ephedra alkaloids that were submitted to the FDA between
June 1, 1997, and March 31, 1999. A standardized rating system for assessing
causation was applied to each adverse event.
RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of cases were considered to be definitely or probably
related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31 percent
were deemed to be possibly related. Among the adverse events that were deemed
definitely, probably, or possibly related to the use of supplements containing
ephedra alkaloids, 47 percent involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18 percent
involved the central nervous system. Hypertension was the single most frequent
adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13);
stroke (10); and seizures (7). Ten events resulted in death, and 13 events
produced permanent disability, representing 26 percent of the definite, probable,
and possible cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids may
pose a health risk to some persons. These findings indicate the need for a better
understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of such dietary
supplements.

BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection has been linked to the
development of Kaposi's sarcoma and to rare lymphoproliferative disorders.
METHODS: We used molecular methods, serologic methods, in situ hybridization, and
immunohistochemical analyses to study HHV-8 infection in association with
nonmalignant illnesses in three patients after transplantation.
RESULTS: Primary HHV-8 infections developed in two patients four months after
each received a kidney from the same HHV-8-seropositive cadaveric donor.
Seroconversion and viremia occurred coincidentally with disseminated Kaposi's
sarcoma in one patient and with an acute syndrome of fever, splenomegaly,
cytopenia, and marrow failure with plasmacytosis in the other patient. HHV-8
latent nuclear antigen was present in immature progenitor cells from the aplastic
marrow of the latter patient. Identification of the highly variable K1 gene
sequence of the HHV-8 genome in both the donor's peripheral-blood cells and the
recipients' serum confirmed that transmission had occurred. HHV-8 viremia also
occurred after autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation in an
HHV-8-seropositive patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Reactivation of the
infection was associated with the development of fever and marrow aplasia with
plasmacytosis; there was no evidence of other infections. HHV-8 transcripts and
latent nuclear antigen were expressed in the aplastic marrow but not in two
normal marrow samples obtained before transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary HHV-8 infection and reactivation of infection may be
associated with nonneoplastic complications in immunosuppressed patients.

BACKGROUND: On the basis of positive results in studies of the transplantation of
pig extremities and the information exchanged at an international symposium on
composite tissue transplantation, we developed a protocol for human hand
transplantation.
METHODS: After a comprehensive pretransplantation evaluation and informed-consent
process, the left hand of a 58-year-old cadaveric donor, matched for size, sex,
and skin tone, was transplanted to a 37-year-old man who had lost his dominant
left hand 13 years earlier. Immunosuppression consisted of basiliximab for
induction therapy and tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone for
maintenance therapy.
RESULTS: The cold-ischemia time of the donor hand was 310 minutes. There were no 
intraoperative or early postoperative complications. Moderate acute cellular
rejection of the skin of the graft developed 6, 20, and 27 weeks after
transplantation. All three episodes resolved completely after treatment with
intravenous methylprednisolone and topical tacrolimus and clobetasol.
Temperature, pain, and pressure sensation had developed in the hand and fingers
by one year. At one year, the patient had regained the ability to perform many
functional activities with his left hand that he had not been able to perform
with his prosthesis, such as throwing a baseball, turning the pages of a
newspaper, writing, and tying his shoelaces.
CONCLUSIONS: Early success has been achieved in hand transplantation with the use
of currently available immunosuppressive drugs.

BACKGROUND: The antiplatelet drug clopidogrel is a new thienopyridine derivative 
whose mechanism of action and chemical structure are similar to those of
ticlopidine. The estimated incidence of ticlopidine-associated thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura is 1 per 1600 to 5000 patients treated, whereas no
clopidogrel-associated cases were observed among 20,000 closely monitored
patients treated in phase 3 clinical trials and cohort studies. Because of the
association between ticlopidine use and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and
other adverse effects, clopidogrel has largely replaced ticlopidine in clinical
practice. More than 3 million patients have received clopidogrel. We report the
clinical and laboratory findings in 11 patients in whom thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura developed during or soon after treatment with
clopidogrel.
METHODS: The 11 patients were identified by active surveillance by the medical
directors of blood banks (3 patients), hematologists (6), and the manufacturer of
clopidogrel (2).
RESULTS: Ten of the 11 patients received clopidogrel for 14 days or less before
the onset of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Although 10 of the 11 patients 
had a response to plasma exchange, 2 required 20 or more exchanges before
clinical improvement occurred, and 2 had relapses while not receiving
clopidogrel. One patient died despite undergoing plasma exchange soon after
diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura can occur after the initiation
of clopidogrel therapy, often within the first two weeks of treatment. Physicians
should be aware of the possibility of this syndrome when initiating clopidogrel
treatment.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Enteritis necroticans (pigbel), an often fatal illness
characterized by hemorrhagic, inflammatory, or ischemic necrosis of the jejunum, 
occurs in developing countries but is rare in developed countries, where its
occurrence is confined to adults with chronic illnesses. The causative organism
of enteritis necroticans is Clostridium perfringens type C, an anaerobic
gram-positive bacillus. In December 1998, enteritis necroticans developed in a
12-year-old boy with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus after he consumed pig
intestines (chitterlings). He presented with hematemesis, abdominal distention,
and severe diabetic ketoacidosis with hypotension. At laparotomy, extensive
jejunal necrosis required bowel resection, jejunostomy, and ileostomy. Samples
were obtained for histopathological examination. Polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) 
assay was performed on paraffin-embedded bowel tissue with primers specific for
the cpa and cpb genes, which code for the alpha and beta toxins produced by C.
perfringens.
RESULTS: Histologic examination of resected bowel tissue showed extensive mucosal
necrosis, the formation of pseudomembrane, pneumatosis, and areas of epithelial
regeneration that alternated with necrotic segments--findings consistent with a
diagnosis of enteritis necroticans. Gram's staining showed large gram-positive
bacilli whose features were consistent with those of clostridium species. Through
PCR amplification, we detected products of the cpa and cpb genes, which indicated
the presence of C. perfringens type C. Assay of ileal tissue obtained during
surgery to restore the continuity of the patient's bowel was negative for C.
perfringens.
CONCLUSIONS: The preparation or consumption of chitterlings by diabetic patients 
and other chronically ill persons can result in potentially life-threatening
infectious complications.

BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents within the
salmonellae is a worldwide problem that has been associated with the use of
antibiotics in livestock. Resistance to ceftriaxone and the fluoroquinolones,
which are used to treat invasive salmonella infections, is rare in the United
States. We analyzed the molecular characteristics of a ceftriaxone-resistant
strain of Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium isolated from a 12-year-old
boy with fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
METHODS: We used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and analysis of plasmids and
beta-lactamases to compare the ceftriaxone-resistant S. enterica serotype
typhimurium from the child with four isolates of this strain obtained from cattle
during a local outbreak of salmonellosis.
RESULTS: The ceftriaxone-resistant isolate from the child was indistinguishable
from one of the isolates from cattle, which was also resistant to ceftriaxone.
Both ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were resistant to 13 antimicrobial agents;
all but one of the resistance determinants were on a conjugative plasmid of 160
kb that encoded the functional group 1 beta-lactamase CMY-2. Both
ceftriaxone-resistant isolates were closely related to the three other salmonella
isolates obtained from cattle, all of which were susceptible to ceftriaxone.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides additional evidence that antibiotic-resistant
strains of salmonella in the United States evolve primarily in livestock.
Resistance to ceftriaxone, the drug of choice for invasive salmonella disease, is
a public health concern, especially with respect to children, since
fluoroquinolones, which can also be used to treat this disease, are not approved 
for use in children.

BACKGROUND: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome characterized by
lightheadedness, fatigue, altered mentation, and syncope and associated with
postural tachycardia and plasma norepinephrine concentrations that are
disproportionately high in relation to sympathetic outflow. We tested the
hypothesis that impaired functioning of the norepinephrine transporter
contributes to the pathophysiologic mechanism of orthostatic intolerance.
METHODS: In a patient with orthostatic intolerance and her relatives, we measured
postural blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, and systemic
norepinephrine spillover and clearance, and we sequenced the
norepinephrine-transporter gene and evaluated its function.
RESULTS: The patient had a high mean plasma norepinephrine concentration while
standing, as compared with the mean (+/-SD) concentration in normal subjects (923
vs. 439+/-129 pg per milliliter [5.46 vs. 2.59+/-0.76 nmol per liter]), reduced
systemic norepinephrine clearance (1.56 vs. 2.42+/-0.71 liters per minute),
impairment in the increase in the plasma norepinephrine concentration after the
administration of tyramine (12 vs. 56+/-63 pg per milliliter [0.07 vs.
0.33+/-0.37 pmol per liter]), and a disproportionate increase in the
concentration of plasma norepinephrine relative to that of dihydroxyphenylglycol.
Analysis of the norepinephrine-transporter gene revealed that the proband was
heterozygous for a mutation in exon 9 (encoding a change from guanine to cytosine
at position 237) that resulted in more than a 98 percent loss of function as
compared with that of the wild-type gene. Impairment of synaptic norepinephrine
clearance may result in a syndrome characterized by excessive sympathetic
activation in response to physiologic stimuli. The mutant allele in the proband's
family segregated with the postural heart rate and abnormal plasma catecholamine 
homeostasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic or acquired deficits in norepinephrine inactivation may
underlie hyperadrenergic states that lead to orthostatic intolerance.

    N Engl J Med. 1999 Nov 11;341(20):1539-40.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Young children rarely transmit tuberculosis. In July
1998, infectious tuberculosis was identified in a nine-year-old boy in North
Dakota who was screened because extrapulmonary tuberculosis had been diagnosed in
his female guardian. The child, who had come from the Republic of the Marshall
Islands in 1996, had bilateral cavitary tuberculosis. Because he was the only
known possible source for his female guardian's tuberculosis, an investigation of
the child's contacts was undertaken. We identified family, school, day-care, and 
other social contacts and notified these people of their exposure. We asked the
contacts to complete a questionnaire and performed tuberculin skin tests.
RESULTS: Of the 276 contacts of the child whom we tested, 56 (20 percent) had a
positive tuberculin skin test (induration of at least 10 mm), including 3 of the 
child's 4 household members, 16 of his 24 classroom contacts, 10 of 32 school-bus
riders, and 9 of 61 day-care contacts. A total of 118 persons received preventive
therapy, including 56 young children who were prescribed preventive therapy until
skin tests performed at least 12 weeks after exposure were negative. The one
additional case identified was in the twin brother of the nine-year-old patient. 
The twin was not considered infectious on the basis of a sputum smear that was
negative on microscopical examination.
CONCLUSIONS: This investigation showed that a young child can transmit
Mycobacterium tuberculosis to a large number of contacts. Children with
tuberculosis, especially cavitary or laryngeal tuberculosis, should be considered
potentially infectious, and screening of their contacts for infection with M.
tuberculosis or active tuberculosis may be required.

BACKGROUND: Human ehrlichiosis is a recently recognized tick-borne infection.
Four species infect humans: Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. sennetsu, E. canis, and the
agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.
METHODS: We tested peripheral-blood leukocytes from 413 patients with possible
ehrlichiosis by broad-range and species-specific polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) 
assays for ehrlichia. The species present were identified by species-specific PCR
assays and nucleotide sequencing of the gene encoding ehrlichia 16S ribosomal
RNA. Western blot analysis was used to study serologic responses.
RESULTS: In four patients, ehrlichia DNA was detected in leukocytes by a
broad-range PCR assay, but not by assays specific for E. chaffeensis or the agent
of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The nucleotide sequences of these PCR
products matched that of E. ewingii, an agent previously reported as a cause of
granulocytic ehrlichiosis in dogs. These four patients, all from Missouri,
presented between May and August 1996, 1997, or 1998 with fever, headache, and
thrombocytopenia, with or without leukopenia. All had been exposed to ticks, and 
three were receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Serum samples obtained from three
of these patients during convalescence contained antibodies that reacted with E. 
chaffeensis and E. canis antigens in a pattern different from that of humans with
E. chaffeensis infection but similar to that of a dog experimentally infected
with E. ewingii. Morulae were identified in neutrophils from two patients. All
four patients were successfully treated with doxycycline.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence of E. ewingii infection in humans.
The associated disease may be clinically indistinguishable from infection caused 
by E. chaffeensis or the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.

BACKGROUND: The technique of tumescent liposuction involves the subcutaneous
infusion of a solution containing lidocaine, followed by the aspiration of fat
through microcannulas. Although the recommended doses of lidocaine are as high as
55 mg per kilogram of body weight, few safety data are available. Since reporting
of adverse events associated with tumescent liposuction is not mandatory, the
incidence of complications and deaths is unknown.
METHODS: We identified 5 deaths after tumescent liposuction among 48,527 deaths
referred to the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of New York City between 1993
and 1998. The patients' records and postmortem examination results were reviewed 
to identify common contributory factors.
RESULTS: The five patients had received lidocaine in doses ranging from 10 to 40 
mg per kilogram. Other drugs, such as midazolam, were also administered. Three
patients died as a result of precipitous intraoperative hypotension and
bradycardia with no definitively identified cause. Postmortem blood lidocaine
concentrations in two of the patients were 5.2 and 2 mg per liter. One patient
died of fluid overload, and one died of deep venous thrombosis of calf veins with
pulmonary thromboembolism after tumescent liposuction of the legs.
CONCLUSIONS: Tumescent liposuction can be fatal, perhaps in part because of
lidocaine toxicity or lidocaine-related drug interactions.

    N Engl J Med. 2000 Oct 12;343(15):1124-5.

BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma occasionally
occur in the same patient. The identification of a common precursor of the two
types of lymphoma would show definitively that Reed-Sternberg cells originate
from B cells.
METHODS: We studied lymphomas from two patients, one with a composite lymphoma
(classic Hodgkin's disease and a follicular lymphoma in the same lymph node) and 
the other with a T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma that was followed by classic
Hodgkin's disease. Single Reed-Sternberg cells and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells
from frozen sections were micromanipulated. The rearranged immunoglobulin
variable-region genes (V genes) of the heavy and light chains were amplified by
the polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and sequenced.
RESULTS: In both patients, the Reed-Sternberg cells were related clonally to the 
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cells. The V genes carried somatic mutations (a hallmark
of germinal-center B cells and their descendants). In both patients, some somatic
mutations were shared by the Reed-Sternberg and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells,
whereas other somatic mutations were found exclusively in one or the other cell
type.
CONCLUSIONS: In two patients with classic Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's
B-cell lymphoma, we identified a common B-cell precursor, probably a
germinal-center B-cell, for both lymphomas. This finding suggests that the two
types of lymphoma underwent both shared and distinct transforming events and
provides proof of the B-cell derivation of Reed-Sternberg cells in classic
Hodgkin's disease.

    N Engl J Med. 1999 Jul 15;341(3):207-8.

BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus,
the glycopeptide vancomycin has been the only uniformly effective treatment for
staphylococcal infections. In 1997, two infections due to S. aureus with reduced 
susceptibility to vancomycin were identified in the United States.
METHODS: We investigated the two patients with infections due to S. aureus with
intermediate resistance to glycopeptides, as defined by a minimal inhibitory
concentration of vancomycin of 8 to 16 microg per milliliter. To assess the
carriage and transmission of these strains of S. aureus, we cultured samples from
the patients and their contacts and evaluated the isolates.
RESULTS: The first patient was a 59-year-old man in Michigan with diabetes
mellitus and chronic renal failure. Peritonitis due to S. aureus with
intermediate resistance to glycopeptides developed after 18 weeks of vancomycin
treatment for recurrent methicillin-resistant S. aureus peritonitis associated
with dialysis. The removal of the peritoneal catheter plus treatment with
rifampin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole eradicated the infection. The second
patient was a 66-year-old man with diabetes in New Jersey. A bloodstream
infection due to S. aureus with intermediate resistance to glycopeptides
developed after 18 weeks of vancomycin treatment for recurrent
methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia. This infection was eradicated with
vancomycin, gentamicin, and rifampin. Both patients died. The
glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus isolates differed by two bands on
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. On electron microscopy, the isolates from the
infected patients had thicker extracellular matrixes than control
methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates. No carriage was documented among 177
contacts of the two patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of S. aureus with intermediate resistance to
glycopeptides emphasizes the importance of the prudent use of antibiotics, the
laboratory capacity to identify resistant strains, and the use of
infection-control precautions to prevent transmission.

BACKGROUND: Fenfluramine and phentermine have been individually approved as
anorectic agents by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When used in
combination the drugs may be just as effective as either drug alone, with the
added advantages of the need for lower doses of each agent and perhaps fewer side
effects. Although the combination has not been approved by the FDA, in 1996 the
total number of prescriptions in the United States for fenfluramine and
phentermine exceeded 18 million.
METHODS: We identified valvular heart disease in 24 women treated with
fenfluramine-phentermine who had no history of cardiac disease. The women
presented with cardiovascular symptoms or a heart murmur. As increasing numbers
of these patients with similar clinical features were identified, there appeared 
to be an association between these features and fenfluramine-phentermine therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-four women (mean [+/-SD] age, 44+/-8 years) were evaluated
12.3+/-7.1 months after the initiation of fenfluramine-phentermine therapy.
Echocardiography demonstrated unusual valvular morphology and regurgitation in
all patients. Both right-sided and left-sided heart valves were involved. Eight
women also had newly documented pulmonary hypertension. To date, cardiac surgical
intervention has been required in five patients. The heart valves had a
glistening white appearance. Histopathological findings included plaque-like
encasement of the leaflets and chordal structures with intact valve architecture.
The histopathological features were identical to those seen in carcinoid or
ergotamine-induced valve disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These cases arouse concern that fenfluramine-phentermine therapy may
be associated with valvular heart disease. Candidates for
fenfluramine-phentermine therapy should be informed about serious potential
adverse effects, including pulmonary hypertension and valvular heart disease.

BACKGROUND: A 17-year-old boy and his father had acute gastroenteritis after
eating spaghetti and pesto that had been prepared four days earlier. Within two
days, fulminant liver failure and rhabdomyolysis developed in the boy and he
died. The father had hyperbilirubinemia and rhabdomyolysis but recovered. We
investigated the cause of these illnesses.
METHODS: Bacteria were isolated and characterized by conventional methods, and
bacterial toxins were quantified by immunoassays and cell-culture techniques. The
effect of the isolated toxin on the rates of oxidation of various substrates was 
analyzed in rat-liver mitochondria.
RESULTS: Autopsy of the boy's liver revealed diffuse microvesicular steatosis and
midzonal necrosis that suggested impaired beta-oxidation of liver mitochondria
due to a mitochondrial toxin. There was no evidence of ingestion of heavy metals,
halogenated compounds, hepatotoxic drugs, or staphylococcal enterotoxin. However,
high concentrations of Bacillus cereus emetic toxin were found in both the
residue from the pan used to reheat the food and the boy's liver and bile. B.
cereus was cultured from the intestinal contents and the pan residue. The emetic 
toxin isolated from the B. cereus cultures was found to be a mitochondrial toxin.
CONCLUSIONS: Fulminant liver failure developed after the ingestion of food
contaminated with the B. cereus emetic toxin. The toxin inhibits hepatic
mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation, indicating that it caused liver failure in
this patient.

Transmission of hepatitis B to patients from four infected surgeons without
hepatitis B e antigen.

Incident Investigation Teams and Others(1).

Author information: 
(1)Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre,
London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to patients by infected
surgeons who carry hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) has been documented repeatedly. 
In the United Kingdom HBeAg-positive surgeons are not permitted to perform
certain procedures that carry a risk that patients might be exposed to the blood 
of a health care worker. There are no practice restrictions for carriers of
hepatitis B surface antigen without detectable HBeAg, unless transmission has
been demonstrated.
METHODS: In four unconnected cases of acute hepatitis B, surgery was identified
as a possible source, so we tested the surgical teams for serologic markers of
HBV infection. In each case a surgeon was found to be infected with the virus.
HBV DNA was amplified by a nested polymerase chain reaction from serum from the
four infected surgeons and the four patients, and direct nucleotide sequencing of
two regions of the HBV genome was performed. Alternative sources of infection
were ruled out. Other patients on whom three of the surgeons had recently
performed procedures were offered testing.
RESULTS: All four surgeons were carriers of HBV, but none had detectable serum
HBeAg. The nucleotide sequences of HBV DNA from the surgeons were
indistinguishable from those from the corresponding patients. The screening of
other exposed patients identified at least two other patients who had probably
acquired hepatitis B infection from one of these surgeons.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons who are carriers of HBV without detectable serum HBeAg can 
transmit HBV to patients during procedures.

BACKGROUND: The Canale-Smith syndrome is a childhood disorder characterized by
lymphadenopathy and autoimmunity. The similarity between this syndrome and that
in mice with the lymphoproliferation (lpr) phenotype or the
generalized-lymphoproliferative-disease (gld) phenotype led us to investigate
whether it too is caused by mutations of the Fas gene (lpr mice) or the Fas
ligand (gld mice), which regulate apoptosis in lymphocytes.
METHODS: We studied four patients with the syndrome and their families.
T-lymphocyte phenotypes were analyzed, and the susceptibility of activated T
cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis in vitro was determined. Mutations of Fas were
sought by nucleotide-sequence analysis.
RESULTS: Patients with the Canale-Smith syndrome had increased numbers of
circulating double-negative T cells (>20 percent) and profoundly impaired
apoptosis of activated T cells incubated with an anti-Fas antibody. Three novel
Fas mutations were identified, all of which were heterozygous and predicted to
impair signal transduction by Fas. Autoimmune manifestations of the disease, such
as hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, persisted into adolescence. Two
patients followed into adulthood had intermittent lymphadenopathy, which
diminished over time. Neoplasms developed in both, and one died of hepatocellular
carcinoma at the age of 43.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the Canale-Smith syndrome have mutations in Fas, which
implicates this gene in the accumulation of lymphocytes and the autoimmunity
characteristic of the syndrome.

    N Engl J Med. 1996 Oct 3;335(14):1069-70.

BACKGROUND: Alendronate, an aminobisphosphonate and a selective inhibitor of
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, is used to treat osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women and Paget's disease of bone. Aminobiphosphonates can
irritate the upper gastrointestinal mucosa.
METHODS: We describe three patients who had severe esophagitis shortly after
starting to take alendronate and also analyze adverse esophageal effects reported
to Merck, the manufacturer, through postmarketing surveillance.
RESULTS: As of March 5, 1996, alendronate had been prescribed for an estimated
475,000 patients worldwide, and 1213 reports of adverse effects had been
received. A total of 199 patients had adverse effects related to the esophagus;
in 51 of these patients (26 percent), including the 3 we describe in case
reports, adverse effects were categorized as serious or severe. Thirty-two
patients (16 percent) were hospitalized, and two were temporarily disabled.
Endoscopic findings generally indicated chemical esophagitis, with erosions or
ulcerations and exudative inflammation accompanied by thickening of the
esophageal wall. Bleeding was rare, and stomach or duodenal involvement unusual. 
In patients for whom adequate information was available, esophagitis seemed to be
associated with swallowing alendronate with little or no water, lying down during
or after ingestion of the tablet, lying down during or after ingestion of the
tablet, continuing to take alendronate after the onset of symptoms, and having
preexisting esophageal disorders.
CONCLUSIONS: Alendronate can cause chemical esophagitis, including severe
ulcerations, in some patients. Recommendations to reduce the risk of esophagitis 
include swallowing alendronate with 180 to 240 ml (6 to 8 oz) of water on arising
in the morning, remaining upright for at least 30 minutes after swallowing the
tablet and until the first food of the day has been ingested, and discontinuing
the drug promptly if esophageal symptoms develop.

BACKGROUND: Patients with lipoprotein lipase deficiency usually present with
chylomicronemia in childhood. The syndrome has been considered nonatherogenic
primarily because of the low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.
We prospectively evaluated patients with lipoprotein lipase deficiency for
atherosclerosis.
METHODS: Evidence of carotid, peripheral, and coronary atherosclerosis was sought
in four patients (two men and two women) with the phenotype of familial
chylomicronemia by clinical examination over a period of 14 to 30 years and by
Doppler ultrasonography, B-mode ultrasonography [corrected], and
exercise-tolerance testing after the age of 40. Angiography was performed when
indicated. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency was assessed in vivo and in vitro by
functional assays and DNA-sequence analysis.
RESULTS: All four patients had a profound functional deficiency of lipoprotein
lipase with a reduced enzymatic mass due to missense mutations on both alleles of
the lipoprotein lipase gene. In all four patients, peripheral or coronary
atherosclerosis (or both) was observed before the age of 55. Despite following a 
low-fat diet in which fat composed 10 to 15 percent of the daily caloric intake, 
the patients had hypertriglyceridemia (mean [+/- SD] triglyceride level, 2621 +/-
1112 mg per deciliter [29.59 +/- 12.55 mmol per liter]), low plasma levels of
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (17 +/- 7 mg per deciliter [0.43 +/- 0.18
mmol per liter]), and very low levels of LDL cholesterol (28 +/- 16 mg per
deciliter [0.72 +/- 0.41 mmol per liter]). Three patients had one risk factor for
atherosclerosis, whereas in one male patient, heavy smoking and diabetes were
associated with an accelerated course of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Premature atherosclerosis can occur in patients with familiar
chylomicronemia as a result of mutations in the lipoprotein lipase gene.
Defective lipolysis may increase susceptibility to atherosclerosis in humans.

    N Engl J Med. 1996 Jan 25;334(4):262-3.

BACKGROUND: Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is a potentially fatal tick-borne
infection that has recently been described. This acute febrile illness is
characterized by myalgias, headache, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum
aminotransferase levels. The disease is difficult to diagnose because the
symptoms are non-specific, intraleukocytic inclusions (morulae) may not be seen, 
and the serologic results are often initially negative. Little is known about the
causative agent because it has never been cultivated.
METHODS: We studied three patients with symptoms and laboratory findings
suggestive of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, including unexplained fever after 
probable exposure to ticks, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Peripheral
blood was examined for ehrlichia microscopically and with use of the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Blood was inoculated into cultures of HL60 cells (a line of
human promyelocytic leukemia cells), and the cultures were monitored for
infection by Giemsa staining and PCR.
RESULTS: Blood from the three patients, only one of whom had inclusions
suggestive of ehrlichia in neutrophils, was positive for human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis on PCR. Blood from all three patients was inoculated into HL60 cell 
cultures and caused infection, with intracellular organisms visualized as early
as 5 days after inoculation and cell lysis occurring within 12 to 14 days. The
identity of the cultured organisms was confirmed by immunofluorescence
microscopy, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. DNA from the infected cells was
sequenced in regions of the 16S ribosomal gene reported to differ between the
agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and closely related species, including
Ehrlichia equi and E. phagocytophila which cause infection in animals. The
sequences from all three human isolates were identical and differed from the
strain of E. equi studied in having guanine rather than adenine at nucleotide 84.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe the cultivation of the agent of human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis in cell culture. The ability to isolate this organism should lead to
a better understanding of the biology, treatment, and epidemiology of this
emerging infection.

Adult-onset spinocerebellar dysfunction caused by a mutation in the gene for the 
alpha-tocopherol-transfer protein.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1995 Nov 16;333(20):1351-3.

BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated vitamin E deficiency have an impaired ability 
to incorporate alpha-tocopherol into lipoproteins in the liver and usually have
symptoms and signs of spinocerebellar dysfunction before adolescence. Accumulated
evidence suggests that the alpha-tocopherol-transfer protein, which is presumed
to function in the intracellular transport of alpha-tocopherol, is abnormal in
these patients.
METHODS: We studied a patient from an isolated Japanese island who began to have 
ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory disturbances in the sixth decade of life. His
serum vitamin E concentration was low (1.2 micrograms per milliliter [2.8 mumol
per liter]). Exons of his gene for the alpha-tocopherol-transfer protein were
analyzed by DNA sequencing. We also screened an additional 801 inhabitants of the
island for the mutation. Both the normal and mutant alpha-to-copherol-transfer
proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and studied by immunoblot analysis and
assay for alpha-tocopherol-transfer activity.
RESULTS: The patient was homozygous for a point mutation that replaces histidine 
(CAT) with glutamine (CAG) at position 101 of the gene for the
alpha-tocopherol-transfer protein. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the missense
mutation produced a functionally defective alpha-tocopherol-transfer protein with
approximately 11 percent of the transfer activity of the wild-type protein. Of
the 801 island inhabitants examined, 21 were heterozygous for the His101Gln
mutation. In all affected subjects, including the patient, this mutation
cosegregated with an intron-sequence polymorphism. The heterozygotes were
phenotypically normal and had serum vitamin E concentrations that were on average
25 percent lower than those of normal subjects (mean [+/- SD], 7.5 +/- 2.2 vs.
10.1 +/- 2.8 micrograms per milliliter [17.4 +/- 5.1 vs. 23.4 +/- 6.5 mumol per
liter]; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: alpha-Tocopherol-transfer protein is a determinant of serum vitamin 
E concentrations. An abnormality in this protein is a cause of spinocerebellar
dysfunction.

    N Engl J Med. 1996 Jan 4;334(1):59.

BACKGROUND: Neonatal diabetes mellitus--defined here as hyperglycemia occurring
within the first month of life that lasts for at least two weeks and requires
insulin therapy--is a very rare form of the disease. Little is known about it,
particularly with respect to its long-term course.
METHODS: We studied two brothers who had neonatal diabetes and obtained follow-up
information on 34 patients described in the literature as well as information on 
21 additional patients. Forty-seven of the patients had neonatal diabetes, as
defined above, and in 10 others the onset was between the first and third month
of life.
RESULTS: Twenty-six of the 57 infants had permanent diabetes, 18 had transient
diabetes, and 13 had transient diabetes that recurred when they were 7 to 20
years old. Neonatal diabetes was associated with the Wolcott-Rallison syndrome in
six infants, hyperuricemia due to phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphatase
hyperactivity in two, and celiac disease in two. Forty-one of 45 neonates in whom
the duration of gestation and birth weight were known were small for their
gestational ages. There were two pairs of affected twins and four other families 
with two or more infants with neonatal diabetes, but only three parents had
diabetes. The incidence of neonatal diabetes mellitus in Germany has been
estimated to be 1 in 500,000 neonates.
CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal diabetes differs from insulin-dependent diabetes in that
its course is highly variable. Some patients have permanent diabetes, but others 
have transient or lasting remissions.

Mutations in the gene for the granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor receptor in
patients with acute myeloid leukemia preceded by severe congenital neutropenia.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1995 Aug 24;333(8):516-8.

BACKGROUND: In severe congenital neutropenia the maturation of myeloid progenitor
cells is arrested. The myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia
develop in some patients with severe congenital neutropenia. Abnormalities in the
signal-transduction pathways for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
may play a part in the progression to acute myeloid leukemia.
METHODS: We isolated genomic DNA and RNA from hematopoietic cells obtained from
two patients with acute myeloid leukemia and histories of severe congenital
neutropenia. The nucleotide sequences encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the
G-CSF receptor were amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction and
sequenced. Murine myeloid 32D.C10 cells were transfected with complementary DNA
encoding the wild-type or mutant G-CSF receptors and tested for their responses
to G-CSF.
RESULTS: Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor were identified in
both patients. The mutations, a substitution of thymine for cytosine at the codon
for glutamine at position 718 (Gln718) in one patient and at the codon for
glutamine at position 731(Gln731) in the other, caused a truncation of the
C-terminal cytoplasmic region of the receptor. Both mutant and wild-type genes
for the G-CSF receptor were present in leukemic cells from the two patients. In
one patient, the mutation was also found in the neutropenic stage, before the
progression to acute myeloid leukemia. The 32D.C10 cells expressing mutant
receptors had abnormally high proliferative responses but failed to mature when
cultured in G-CSF. The mutant G-CSF receptors also interfered with terminal
maturation mediated by the wild-type G-CSF receptor in the 32D.C10 cells that
coexpressed the wild-type and mutant receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor that interrupt signals 
required for the maturation of myeloid cells are involved in the pathogenesis of 
severe congenital neutropenia and associated with the progression to acute
myeloid leukemia.

    N Engl J Med. 1995 Apr 27;332(17):1163-4.

BACKGROUND: Trials are under way to determine whether fetal nigral grafts can
improve motor function in patients with Parkinson's disease. Some studies use
fluorodopa uptake on positron-emission tomography (PET) as a marker of graft
viability, but fluorodopa uptake does not distinguish between host and grafted
neurons. There has been no direct evidence that grafts of fetal tissue can
survive and innervate the striatum.
METHODS: We studied a 59-year-old man with advanced Parkinson's disease who
received bilateral grafts of fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue in the
postcommissural putamen. The tissue came from seven embryos between 6 1/2 and 9
weeks after conception. The patient died 18 months later from a massive pulmonary
embolism. The brain was studied with the use of tyrosine hydroxylase
immunohistochemical methods.
RESULTS: After transplantation, the patient had sustained improvement in motor
function and a progressive increase in fluorodopa uptake in the putamen on PET
scanning. On examination of the brain, each of the large grafts appeared to be
viable. Each was integrated into the host striatum and contained dense clusters
of dopaminergic neurons. Processes from these neurons had grown out of the grafts
and provided extensive dopaminergic reinnervation to the striatum in a
patch-matrix pattern. Ungrafted regions of the putamen showed sparse dopaminergic
innervation. We could not identify any sprouting of host dopaminergic processes.
CONCLUSIONS: Grafts of fetal mesencephalic tissue can survive for a long period
in the human brain and restore dopaminergic innervation to the striatum in
patients with Parkinson's disease. In the patient we studied, clinical
improvement and enhanced fluorodopa with uptake on PET scanning were associated
the survival of the grafts and dopaminergic reinnervation of the striatum.

    N Engl J Med. 1995 Mar 30;332(13):883-4.

BACKGROUND: We describe a child who was identified shortly after birth as
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), but whose
infection appears to have completely cleared. Asymptomatic HIV-1 infection was
diagnosed in the mother during the fourth month of pregnancy. The infant was
delivered vaginally at 36 weeks, received no blood products, and was not
breast-fed.
METHODS AND RESULTS: HIV-1 was detected by culture of the infant's
peripheral-blood mononuclear cells at 19 and 51 days of age. Plasma from the
infant was also culture-positive for HIV-1 at 51 days of age by DNA polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Nucleotide-sequence analysis of HIV-1 DNA showed extremely 
close homology of the cultures obtained 32 days apart, and forensic markers of
genetic identity for the two cultures were identical. Hence, inadvertent viral
contamination or error in the collection of specimens was highly unlikely. At 12 
months of age the infant was seronegative for HIV-1, and numerous subsequent
cultures and tests by PCR have also been negative for HIV-1. The child is five
years of age at this writing, is HIV-seronegative, and remains well, with normal 
growth and development and no laboratory or clinical evidence of HIV-1 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The infant we describe was infected perinatally with HIV-1, but the 
infection subsequently cleared and the infant remained without detectable HIV-1
infection five years later.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1995 Feb 16;332(7):463-4.

BACKGROUND: Bartonella (Rochalimaea) quintana is the agent of trench fever and is
transmitted by the body louse. We searched for this organism in three alcoholic
homeless men with endocarditis.
METHODS: Blood samples were cultured on a human endothelial cell line and on
blood agar. Bacteria were identified by sequencing the amplified 16S ribosomal
RNA gene. The presence of bartonella in tissue was assessed by Gram's staining,
immunostaining, and polymerase-chain-reaction amplification. Serologic studies
for antibodies to bartonella species were performed by indirect
immunofluorescence and Western immunoblotting.
RESULTS: B. quintana was isolated from one patient in the blood-agar culture and 
from the other two patients in the endothelial-cell culture. The organism was
also identified by both immunostaining and molecular techniques in the valvular
vegetations from the three patients and in a cervical lymph node from one
patient. The 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of the three isolates were almost
identical to that of the prototype strain of B. quintana. High titers of
antibodies to B. quintana were detected in all three patients, but so were
cross-reacting antibodies to chlamydia species. In all three patients studies
were repeatedly negative for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus.
CONCLUSIONS: B. quintana is a cause of endocarditis in homeless patients and may 
be serologically misdiagnosed as a chlamydial infection.

BACKGROUND: Human babesiosis is a tick-transmitted zoonosis associated with two
protozoa of the family Piroplasmorida: Babesia microti (in the United States) and
B. divergens (in Europe). Recently, infection with an unusual babesia-like
piroplasm (designated WA1) was described in a patient from Washington State. We
studied four patients in California who were identified as being infected with a 
similar protozoal parasite. All four patients had undergone splenectomy, three
because of trauma and one because of Hodgkin's disease. Two of the patients had
complicated courses, and one died.
METHODS: Piroplasm-specific nuclear small-subunit ribosomal DNA was recovered
from the blood of the four patients by amplification with the polymerase chain
reaction. The genetic sequences were compared with those of other known piroplasm
species. Indirect immunofluorescent-antibody testing of serum from the four
patients and from other potentially exposed persons was performed with WA1 and
babesia antigens.
RESULTS: Genetic sequence analysis showed that the organisms from all four
patients were nearly identical. Phylogenic analysis showed that this strain is
more closely related to a known canine pathogen (B. gibsoni) and to theileria
species than to some members of the genus babesia. Serum from three of the
patients was reactive to WA1 but not to B. microti antigen. Serologic testing
showed WA1-antibody seroprevalence rates of 16 percent (8 of 51 persons at risk) 
and 3.5 percent (4 of 115) in two geographically distinct areas of northern
California.
CONCLUSIONS: A newly identified babesia-like organism causes infections in humans
in the western United States. The clinical spectrum associated with infection
with this protozoan ranges from asymptomatic infection or influenza-like illness 
to fulminant, fatal disease.

BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, some lymphomas, and lymphoproliferative disease after organ
transplantation. Many lymphoproliferative tumors that occur after transplantation
are clonal, a property that classifies them as neoplastic. Clonality can be
determined by analysis of the extrachromosomal circular DNA episomes produced by 
EBV infection.
METHODS: We describe three young children in whom smooth-muscle tumors developed 
18 months to 5 1/2 years after liver transplantation with immunosuppression. We
examined the tumors by microscopy and with immunohistochemical studies and
molecular genetic analyses of the EBV DNA:
RESULTS: The tumors were composed of spindle cells with smooth-muscle features
and resembled those described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for EBV latent membrane
protein and EBV receptor (CD21), but positive for EBV nuclear antigen 2. In situ 
hybridization revealed nuclear EBV sequences, and molecular genetic analysis
showed the EBV genome to be clonal in all three patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Smooth-muscle tumors that developed after organ transplantation
contained clonal EBV, suggesting that the virus has a role in the development of 
these neoplastic lesions.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Mutations in the estrogen-receptor gene have been thought
to be lethal. A 28-year-old man whose estrogen resistance was caused by a
disruptive mutation in the estrogen-receptor gene underwent studies of
pituitary-gonadal function and bone density and received transdermal estrogen for
six months. Estrogen-receptor DNA, extracted from lymphocytes, was evaluated by
analysis of single-strand-conformation polymorphisms and by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: The patient was tall (204 cm [80.3 in.]) and had incomplete epiphyseal
closure, with a history of continued linear growth into adulthood despite
otherwise normal pubertal development. He was normally masculinized and had
bilateral axillary acanthosis nigricans. Serum estradiol and estrone
concentrations were elevated, and serum testosterone concentrations were normal. 
Serum follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone concentrations were
increased. Glucose tolerance was impaired, and hyperinsulinemia was present. The 
bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 0.745 g per square centimeter, 3.1
SD below the mean for age-matched normal women; there was biochemical evidence of
increased bone turnover. The patient had no detectable response to estrogen
administration, despite a 10-fold increase in the serum free estradiol
concentration. Conformation analysis of his estrogen-receptor gene revealed a
variant banding pattern in exon 2. Direct sequencing of exon 2 revealed a
cytosine-to-thymine transition at codon 157 of both alleles, resulting in a
premature stop codon. The patient's parents were heterozygous carriers of this
mutation, and pedigree analysis revealed consanguinity.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of the estrogen receptor in humans need not be lethal.
Estrogen is important for bone maturation and mineralization in men as well as
women.

BACKGROUND: Computer-based diagnostic systems are available commercially, but
there has been limited evaluation of their performance. We assessed the
diagnostic capabilities of four internal medicine diagnostic systems: Dxplain,
Iliad, Meditel, and QMR.
METHODS: Ten expert clinicians created a set of 105 diagnostically challenging
clinical case summaries involving actual patients. Clinical data were entered
into each program with the vocabulary provided by the program's developer. Each
of the systems produced a ranked list of possible diagnoses for each patient, as 
did the group of experts. We calculated scores on several performance measures
for each computer program.
RESULTS: No single computer program scored better than the others on all
performance measures. Among all cases and all programs, the proportion of correct
diagnoses ranged from 0.52 to 0.71, and the mean proportion of relevant diagnoses
ranged from 0.19 to 0.37. On average, less than half the diagnoses on the
experts' original list of reasonable diagnoses were suggested by any of the
programs. However, each program suggested an average of approximately two
additional diagnoses per case that the experts found relevant but had not
originally considered.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide a profile of the strengths and limitations of
these computer programs. The programs should be used by physicians who can
identify and use the relevant information and ignore the irrelevant information
that can be produced.

BACKGROUND: Karen Ann Quinlan had a cardiopulmonary arrest in 1975 and died 10
years later, having never regained consciousness. Her story prompted a national
debate about the appropriateness of life-sustaining treatment in patients who are
in a persistent vegetative state and led to the development of medicolegal
guidelines for the care of such patients. This report describes the
neuropathologic features of Quinlan's brain.
METHODS: The entire brain and spinal cord were systematically sampled for
histologic examination. The brain stem and central cerebrum were embedded en bloc
and serially sectioned. Three-dimensional computer reconstructions helped
visualize the topographic features of the lesions.
RESULTS: Contrary to expectation, the most severe damage was not in the cerebral 
cortex but in the thalamus, and the brain stem was relatively intact. The
neuropathological findings included extensive bilateral thalamic scarring,
bilateral cortical scars primarily in the occipital pole and parasagittal
parieto-occipital region, and bilateral damage to cerebellar and
focal-basal-ganglia regions. The brain stem and basal forebrain and the
hypothalamic components of the ascending arousal systems and brainstem regions
critical to cardiac and respiratory control were undamaged. The lesions were
consistent with hypoxia-ischemia after the cardiopulmonary arrest.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the neuropathological findings in the case of Karen Ann
Quinlan were complex, the disproportionately severe damage in the thalamus as
compared with the cerebral cortex supports the hypothesis that the thalamus is
critical for cognition and awareness and may be less essential for arousal.

Treatment of refractory disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infection with 
interferon gamma. A preliminary report.

JI.

(1)Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.

BACKGROUND: Studies conducted in vitro and in animals suggest that cytokine
signals to monocytes or macrophages by interferon gamma are important in the
containment and clearance of disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial
infections.
METHODS: We studied seven patients with refractory, disseminated nontuberculous
mycobacterial infections who were not infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus. Three patients were from a family predisposed to the development of
Mycobacterium avium complex infections; four patients had idiopathic CD4+
T-lymphocytopenia. Their infections were culture- or biopsy-proved, involved at
least two organ systems, and had been treated with the maximal tolerated medical 
therapy. Cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and phagocyte function were
assessed in peripheral-blood cells. Interferon gamma was administered
subcutaneously two or three times weekly in a dose of 25 to 50 micrograms per
square meter of body-surface area in addition to antimycobacterial medications.
Clinical effects were monitored by cultures, biopsies, radiographs, and in one
patient a change in the need for paracentesis.
RESULTS: In response to phytohemagglutinin, the production of interferon gamma by
mononuclear cells from the patients was lower than in normal subjects (P <
0.001), whereas stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate led to
normal production of interferon gamma in the patients. Within eight weeks of the 
start of interferon gamma therapy, all seven patients had marked clinical
improvement, with abatement of fever, clearing of many lesions and quiescence of 
others, radiographic improvement, and a reduction in the need for paracentesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Interferon gamma in combination with conventional therapy may be
effective for some cases of refractory disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial 
infection.

    N Engl J Med. 1994 Sep 8;331(10):679-80.

BACKGROUND: Lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a complication
of bone marrow transplantation that responds poorly to standard forms of therapy.
The lymphoma is usually of donor origin. We hypothesized that treatment with
infusions of donor leukocytes, which contain cytotoxic T cells presensitized to
EBV, might be an effective treatment.
METHODS: We studied five patients in whom EBV-associated lymphoproliferative
disorders developed after they received a T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow 
transplant. Biopsy specimens were immunophenotyped, subjected to the polymerase
chain reaction to determine the origin of the lymphoma (donor or host) and to
detect the presence of EBV, and analyzed by Southern blotting for the presence of
the clonal EBV genome and immunoglobulin-gene rearrangement. Patients were
treated with infusions of unirradiated donor leukocytes at doses calculated to
provide approximately 1.0 x 10(6) CD3+ T cells per kilogram of body weight.
RESULTS: Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens from all five patients
demonstrated monomorphic, malignant lymphomas of B-cell origin. Each of the four 
specimens that could be evaluated was of donor-cell origin. Evidence of clonality
was found in two of the three samples adequate for study. EBV DNA was detected by
the polymerase chain reaction in all five samples. In all five patients there
were complete pathological or clinical responses. The responses were first
documented histologically within 8 to 21 days after infusion. Clinical remissions
were achieved within 14 to 30 days after the infusions and were sustained without
further therapy in the three surviving patients for 10, 16, and 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In a small number of patients, infusions of unirradiated donor
leukocytes were an effective treatment for EBV-associated lymphoproliferative
disease that arose after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.

    N Engl J Med. 1994 Aug 25;331(8):546-8.

BACKGROUND: In May 1993 an outbreak of severe respiratory illness occurred in the
southwestern United States. A previously unknown hantavirus was identified as the
cause. In Asia hantaviruses are associated with hemorrhagic fever and renal
disease. They have not been known as a cause of human disease in North America.
METHODS: We analyzed clinical, laboratory, and autopsy data on the first 17
persons with confirmed infection from this newly recognized strain of hantavirus.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 32.2 years (range, 13 to 64); 61
percent were women, 72 percent were Native American, 22 percent white, and 6
percent Hispanic. The most common prodromal symptoms were fever and myalgia (100 
percent), cough or dyspnea (76 percent), gastrointestinal symptoms (76 percent), 
and headache (71 percent). The most common physical findings were tachypnea (100 
percent), tachycardia (94 percent), and hypotension (50 percent). The laboratory 
findings included leukocytosis (median peak cell count, 26,000 per cubic
millimeter), often with myeloid precursors, an increased hematocrit,
thrombocytopenia (median lowest platelet count, 64,000 per cubic millimeter),
prolonged prothrombin and partial-thromboplastin times, an elevated serum lactate
dehydrogenase concentration, decreased serum protein concentrations, and
proteinuria. Rapidly progressive acute pulmonary edema developed in 15 of the 17 
patients (88 percent), and 13 patients, all of whom had profound hypotension,
died (case fatality rate, 76 percent). Increases in the hematocrit and
partial-thromboplastin time were predictive of death.
CONCLUSIONS: Infection with a newly described hantavirus causes the hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, which is characterized by a brief prodromal illness followed 
by rapidly progressive, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

X-linked pyridoxine-responsive sideroblastic anemia due to a Thr388-to-Ser
substitution in erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1994 Mar 10;330(10):709-11.

BACKGROUND: X-linked sideroblastic anemia is usually associated with reduced
5-aminolevulinate synthase activity in erythroid cells, and some cases are
responsive to treatment with pyridoxine, the precursor to the cofactor of the
enzyme. The recently identified gene for an erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate 
synthase isoenzyme and its localization to the X chromosome make it likely that
one or more defects in this gene underlie the anemia.
METHODS: Using a polymorphic dinucleotide-repeat sequence in the erythroid
5-aminolevulinate synthase gene, we confirmed the linkage of this gene to the
disorder in a family with X-linked pyridoxine-responsive sideroblastic anemia. We
therefore sought evidence of a nucleotide-sequence abnormality in the erythroid
5-aminolevulinate synthase gene by analyzing enzymatically amplified DNA.
RESULTS: DNA-sequencing studies in two affected males and one carrier female in
the kindred demonstrated a cytosine-to-guanine change at nucleotide 1215 (in exon
8). This change results in the substitution of serine for threonine at amino acid
residue 388, near the lysine that binds the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. In
expression studies, the activity of the mutant enzyme was reduced relative to
that of the wild type, and this reduction was comparable to that in erythroid
cells of the proband during relapse of the anemia; the enzyme activity expressed 
in the presence of pyridoxine was comparable to that in the proband's marrow
cells during remission. Although the affinity of the mutant enzyme for pyridoxal 
phosphate was not altered, the mutation appears to introduce a conformational
change at the active site of the enzyme.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a point mutation resulting in an amino acid change
near the pyridoxal phosphate-binding site of the erythroid 5-aminolevulinate
synthase isoenzyme as the underlying defect in a kindred with X-linked
pyridoxine-responsive sideroblastic anemia.

Mutations of the P gene in oculocutaneous albinism, ocular albinism, and
Prader-Willi syndrome plus albinism.

Lee ST(1), Nicholls RD, Bundey S, Laxova R, Musarella M, Spritz RA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.

BACKGROUND: Type II (tyrosinase-positive) oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal
recessive disorder that has recently been mapped to chromosome segment 15q11-q13.
The frequency of this disorder is greatly increased in patients with Prader-Willi
or Angelman syndrome, both of which involve deletions of chromosome 15q. The P
protein is a transmembrane polypeptide that may transport small molecules such as
tyrosine, the precursor of melanin. The P gene is located in chromosome segment
15q11-q13.
METHODS: We studied the tyrosinase and P genes in three patients with type II
oculocutaneous albinism, one of whom also had Prader-Willi syndrome, and in one
patient with a milder syndrome known as autosomal recessive ocular albinism.
Individual exons of these genes were amplified from the DNA of each patient by
the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by simultaneous analyses
of single-stranded conformation polymorphisms and heteroduplexes and subsequent
DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Mutations of the P gene were identified in all four patients. These
included one frame shift, three missense mutations that result in amino acid
substitutions, and one mutation that affects RNA splicing. The patient with
Prader-Willi syndrome plus albinism had a typical deletion of the paternal
chromosome 15, rendering him hemizygous for a maternally inherited mutant allele 
of the P gene. The child with ocular albinism was heterozygous for two different 
mutations in the P gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the P gene are associated with a wide range of
clinical phenotypes, including type II oculocutaneous albinism, albinism
associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, and at least some cases of autosomal
recessive ocular albinism.

Acute fluoride poisoning from a public water system.

Gessner BD(1), Beller M, Middaugh JP, Whitford GM.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Field Epidemiology, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta.

BACKGROUND: Acute fluoride poisoning produces a clinical syndrome characterized
by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and paresthesias. In May 1992,
excess fluoride in one of two public water systems serving a village in Alaska
caused an outbreak of acute fluoride poisoning.
METHODS: We surveyed residents, measured their urinary fluoride concentrations,
and analyzed their serum-chemistry profiles. A case of fluoride poisoning was
defined as an illness consisting of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,
or numbness or tingling of the face or extremities that began between May 21 and 
23.
RESULTS: Among 47 residents studied who drank water obtained on May 21, 22, or 23
from the implicated well, 43 (91 percent) had an illness that met the case
definition, as compared with only 6 of 21 residents (29 percent) who drank water 
obtained from the implicated well at other times and 2 of 94 residents (2
percent) served by the other water system. We estimated that 296 people were
poisoned; 1 person died. Four to five days after the outbreak, 10 of the 25 case 
patients who were tested, but none of the 15 control subjects, had elevated
urinary fluoride concentrations. The case patients had elevated serum fluoride
concentrations and other abnormalities consistent with fluoride poisoning, such
as elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase
concentrations. The fluoride concentration of a water sample from the implicated 
well was 150 mg per liter, and that of a sample from the other system was 1.1 mg 
per liter. Failure to monitor and respond appropriately to elevated fluoride
concentrations, an unreliable control system, and a mechanism that allowed
fluoride concentrate to enter the well led to this outbreak.
CONCLUSIONS: Inspection of public water systems and monitoring of fluoride
concentrations are needed to prevent outbreaks of fluoride poisoning.

    N Engl J Med. 1994 Jun 9;330(23):1686-7.

BACKGROUND: The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (frequency, 1:20,000 to 1:40,000) is
defined by a constellation of severe birth defects affecting most organ systems. 
Abnormalities frequently include profound mental retardation, severe failure to
thrive, and a high infant-mortality rate. The syndrome has heretofore been
diagnosed only from its clinical presentation.
METHODS: Using capillary-column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we measured
the sterol composition of plasma, erythrocytes, lens, cultured fibroblasts, and
feces from five children with the syndrome (three girls and two boys).
RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol levels were abnormally low (8 to 101 mg per deciliter
[0.20 to 2.60 mmol per liter]) in every patient, being well below the 5th
percentile for age- and sex-matched controls. Concentrations of the cholesterol
precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol (cholesta-5,7-dien-3 beta-ol), which was not
detectable in most of our controls, were elevated (11 to 31 mg per deciliter)
more than 2000-fold above normal and were similar to the levels of cholesterol in
all tissues from all patients. An isomeric dehydrocholesterol with a structure
similar to that of 7-dehydrocholesterol was also detected.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of abnormally low plasma cholesterol levels and a
high concentration of the cholesterol precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol points to a 
major block in cholesterol biosynthesis at the step in which the C-7(8) double
bond of 7-dehydrocholesterol is reduced, forming cholesterol. The block may be
sufficient to deprive an embryo or fetus of cholesterol and prevent normal
development, whereas the incorporation of 7-dehydrocholesterol into all membranes
may interfere with proper membrane function.

BACKGROUND: Among patients with the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome who have focal 
and segmental glomerulosclerosis and undergo renal transplantation, 15 to 55
percent have recurrent nephrotic syndrome. The recurrence may be caused by a
plasma factor or factors that increase glomerular permeability, because plasma
exchange transiently decreases or abolishes proteinuria in some patients. We
studied the effect on proteinuria of the removal of protein (mostly
immunoglobulins) by adsorption onto protein A from the plasma of patients with
recurrent nephrotic syndrome.
METHODS: Eight patients were treated with one to three cycles of two to seven
1-day sessions of protein adsorption, and the patients' urinary protein excretion
was measured repeatedly. Their immunosuppressive regimens were not changed during
the treatment. The adsorbed proteins were eluted from the protein A and injected 
into rats, and the urinary albumin excretion of the rats was measured.
RESULTS: The protein-adsorption treatment consistently decreased urinary protein 
excretion by an average of 82 percent at the end of a cycle (P < 0.001). In one
patient proteinuria disappeared, and in another urinary protein excretion
remained below 2.5 g per day with repeated cycles of protein adsorption. In all
but one patient the effect of adsorption was limited in time, with a return to
the preadsorption level of protein excretion within a maximum of two months. The 
administration to rats of material eluted from the protein A increased urinary
albumin excretion 2.9- to 4.6-fold (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively).
Although protein A primarily binds immunoglobulins, the active fraction of the
eluted proteins had a molecular weight below 100,000, indicating that
immunoglobulin was not directly involved.
CONCLUSIONS: Adsorption of plasma protein decreases urinary protein excretion in 
patients with recurrence of the nephrotic syndrome after renal transplantation.
Studies of the adsorbed proteins should provide information about the mechanism
of this disease.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We describe a child who apparently acquired human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the home setting. The
suspected source of infection was a child with the acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome who had received zidovudine and whose virus contained a mutation
associated with in vitro zidovudine resistance. The children were born to
different HIV-1-infected mothers, but they lived in the same home between the
ages of two and five years. Child 1 was infected perinatally; Child 2 was not and
was repeatedly found to be seronegative. Child 2 was examined because of acute
lymphadenopathy and had seroconverted to HIV-1 positivity. HIV-1 proviral DNA was
amplified from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and subjected to sequence
analysis. Sequences from Child 2 were compared with those from Child 2's mother, 
Child 1, and local HIV-1-infected control children.

Overwhelming pulmonary blastomycosis associated with the adult respiratory
distress syndrome.

Meyer KC(1), McManus EJ, Maki DG.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Pulmonary Medicine, University of Wisconsin Medical School,
Madison.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Few cases of overwhelming pulmonary blastomycosis
associated with the adult respiratory distress syndrome have been reported. We
describe 10 patients with this condition who were treated at one center in
Wisconsin.
RESULTS: All 10 patients presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea; radiographic
evidence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates; and marked impairment of oxygenation. 
The mean alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was 616 mm Hg. Six of the patients had
no underlying disease associated with altered immunity, and two had no recent
exposure to environmental reservoirs of Blastomyces dermatitidis. In all 10
patients, large numbers of broad-based budding yeasts were seen on microscopical 
examination of tracheal secretions. All patients were treated with intravenous
amphotericin B (0.7 to 1.0 mg per kilogram per day). Of the five survivors, four 
received full doses of amphotericin B in the first 24 hours, and four required
mechanical ventilatory support for 7 to 151 days. Long-term follow-up of three
survivors showed good recovery of pulmonary function.
CONCLUSIONS: Overwhelming infection with B. dermatitidis can cause diffuse
pneumonitis and the adult respiratory distress syndrome, even in immunocompetent 
hosts. With prompt diagnosis by microscopical examination of tracheal secretions,
intensive therapy with amphotericin B, and ventilatory support, good recovery of 
pulmonary function is possible.

BACKGROUND: Central diabetes insipidus may be familial, secondary to hypothalamic
or pituitary disorders, or idiopathic. Idiopathic central diabetes insipidus is
characterized by selective hypofunction of the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial
system, but its cause is unknown.
METHODS: We studied 17 patients with idiopathic diabetes insipidus, in whom the
duration of the disorder ranged from 2 months to 20 years. Only four patients had
been treated with vasopressin before the study began. All the patients underwent 
endocrinologic studies and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 1.5-T
superconducting unit, and two patients had biopsies of the neurohypophysis or the
pituitary stalk.
RESULTS: Nine of the 17 patients had thickening of the pituitary stalk,
enlargement of the neurohypophysis, or both and lacked the hyperintense signal of
the normal neurohypophysis. In the remaining eight patients, the pituitary stalk 
and the neurohypophysis were normal, although the hyperintense signal was absent.
The abnormalities of thickening and enlargement were seen on MRI only in the
patients who had had diabetes insipidus for less than two years, and the
abnormalities disappeared during follow-up, suggesting a self-limited process. In
addition to vasopressin deficiency, two patients had mild hyperprolactinemia and 
nine had impaired secretory responses of growth hormone to insulin-induced
hypoglycemia. The two biopsies revealed chronic inflammation, with infiltration
of lymphocytes (mainly T lymphocytes) and plasma cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes insipidus can be caused by lymphocytic
infundibuloneurohypophysitis, which can be detected by MRI. The natural course of
the disorder is self-limited.

Seabather's eruption.

Freudenthal AR(1), Joseph PR.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Seabather's eruption is an annoying pruritic dermatitis that appears 
on the areas covered by the bathing suit as an erythematous macular or papular
dermatitis, with or without urticaria. It occurs sporadically in Florida, the
Caribbean, and as far north as Bermuda. The cause is not known.
METHODS: We collected information in Nassau County, Long Island, New York, about 
cases of all types of water-related dermatitis reported by beach personnel,
health providers, and affected swimmers from 1970 through 1991. Concurrently, we 
surveyed all Nassau County swimming waters, especially during the summer season
(June through September), for the presence of organisms capable of causing
dermatitis. In 1980 a sudden epidemic of a severe, unfamiliar dermatitis in ocean
bathers prompted increased surveillance of cases and waters. Planula larvae of
the phylum Cnidaria were collected from the ocean and beaches and inside bathing 
suits. They were examined, photographed, tested on healthy subjects, and observed
in the laboratory for metamorphosis.
RESULTS: Three outbreaks of seabather's eruption have occurred on Long Island
since 1975. The first, in August 1975, affected a small number of swimmers on the
eastern end of Long Island. In 1980 there were thousands of cases along the
entire south shore of the island, and in 1990 there were hundreds in the same
area. In nonepidemic years, five or fewer cases have been reported yearly.
Surveillance for larvae revealed them to be present during the swimming season in
epidemic years, but in nonepidemic years they did not appear until autumn, after 
the swimming season. Applying larvae to the skin of healthy subjects produced a
dermatitis indistinguishable from seabather's eruption. All larvae metamorphosed 
in the laboratory to the adult sea anemone Edwardsiella lineata.
CONCLUSIONS: Seabather's eruption, previously reported only as sporadic cases in 
southern climates, has occurred sporadically and in outbreaks 1000 miles north of
most previously described cases. These Long Island episodes were probably caused 
by the planula larvae of E. lineata.

BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis, usually caused by Leishmania donovani, has
rarely been reported from eastern Saudi Arabia, so it was not expected to affect 
the soldiers of Operation Desert Storm.
METHODS: We evaluated eight soldiers with visceral leishmanial infection,
examining their serum with an immunofluorescent-antibody assay, examining their
marrow or biopsy tissue for amastigotes with an indirect
immunofluorescent-monoclonal-antibody assay, and culturing the parasites.
Cultured promastigotes were isolated and characterized by isoenzyme analysis.
RESULTS: None of the eight soldiers had classic signs or symptoms of visceral
leishmaniasis (kala-azar). Seven soldiers had unexplained fever, chronic fatigue,
malaise, cough, intermittent diarrhea, or abdominal pain that began up to seven
months after they returned to the United States; one had no symptoms. Five had
adenopathy or mild, transient hepatosplenomegaly. None had cutaneous
manifestations. Diagnoses were made by bone marrow aspiration (seven patients) or
lymph-node biopsy (one patient). Six isolates have been identified as L. tropica,
which usually causes only cutaneous disease. Of the six patients treated with
sodium stibogluconate, five improved and one remained symptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: L. tropica can produce visceral infection that can cause unexplained
systemic illness in persons returning from areas where this organism is endemic.

Altered metabolism of mast-cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) in cutaneous
mastocytosis.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The lesions of cutaneous mastocytosis are characterized
by dermal infiltrates of mast cells and may appear hyperpigmented because of the 
presence of increased levels of epidermal melanin. Mast-cell growth factor, the
ligand for the product of the c-kit proto-oncogene, stimulates the proliferation 
of mast cells and increases the production of melanin by melanocytes. We
therefore looked for the expression of the mast-cell growth factor gene in the
skin of patients with cutaneous mastocytosis using immunohistochemical techniques
and the polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: In the skin of normal subjects and those with unrelated diseases,
immunoreactive mast-cell growth factor was associated with keratinocytes and
scattered dermal cells, a pattern consistent with cell-bound mast-cell growth
factor. In skin samples containing lesions and in clinically normal skin from
patients with mastocytosis, however, mast-cell growth factor was also found free 
in the dermis and in the extracellular spaces between keratinocytes, suggesting
the presence of a soluble form of this protein. Messenger RNA (mRNA) that can
encode soluble mast-cell growth factor was present in the skin of patients as
well as in that of normal control subjects. No sequence abnormalities were
detected in mRNA for mast-cell growth factor from one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: The altered distribution of mast-cell growth factor in the skin of
patients with cutaneous mastocytosis is consistent with abnormal production of
the soluble form of this factor. This abnormality is probably due to increased
proteolytic processing, since it was not explained by differences in the splicing
or sequence of mast-cell growth factor mRNA in the patients. Soluble mast-cell
growth factor may cause the characteristic accumulation of mast cells and the
hyperpigmentation of skin found in cutaneous mastocytosis. These findings suggest
that some forms of mastocytosis represent reactive hyperplasia rather than
mast-cell neoplasia.

Autoantibodies to a 128-kd synaptic protein in three women with the stiff-man
syndrome and breast cancer.

Cartlidge N, Bottazzo GF, Piccolo G, De Camilli P, et al.

BACKGROUND: The stiff-man syndrome is a rare disease of the central nervous
system characterized by progressive rigidity of the body musculature.
Autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase are present in about 
60 percent of patients with the syndrome. In this group, there is a striking
association of the stiff-man syndrome with organ-specific autoimmune diseases,
primarily insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: We studied three women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer,
seeking autoantibodies directed against nervous system antigens in serum and
cerebrospinal fluid by immunocytochemical techniques, Western blotting, and
immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Autoantibodies directed against a 128-kd brain protein were found in two
of the women with the stiff-man syndrome and breast cancer. These results led to 
a search for breast cancer in the third patient with the stiff-man syndrome, who 
also had autoantibodies. A small invasive ductal carcinoma was detected by
ultrasonography and removed. Serum samples from all three patients were negative 
for autoantibodies directed against glutamic acid decarboxylase. Autoantibodies
against the 128-kd antigen were not detected in control patients with the
stiff-man syndrome without breast cancer or in patients with cancer who did not
have the syndrome. Within the nervous system, the 128-kd autoantigen was
localized in neurons and concentrated at synapses.
CONCLUSIONS: In a subgroup of patients with the stiff-man syndrome, the condition
is likely to have an autoimmune paraneoplastic origin. The detection of
autoantibodies against the 128-kd antigen in patients with this syndrome should
be considered an indication to search for an occult breast cancer.

United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Myotonic dystrophy is the most common inherited form of muscular
dystrophy affecting adults. Its symptoms are not confined to muscle, and
variability in their nature and in the patient's age at their onset can make
diagnosis difficult. A specific unstable DNA sequence associated with myotonic
dystrophy has recently been identified. We describe the use of a DNA probe
(p5B1.4) that can detect this mutation directly, improving the accuracy and speed
of diagnosis.
METHODS: We analyzed DNA extracted from the peripheral-blood lymphocytes of 112
unrelated patients with myotonic dystrophy and their families, using molecular
genetic techniques. Southern blot analysis and amplification with the polymerase 
chain reaction were used to determine the extent of expansion of the unstable DNA
sequence.
RESULTS: Probe p5B1.4 allowed direct identification of the myotonic dystrophy
mutation in 108 of the 112 unrelated patients. In three families for whom the
clinical and genetic data obtained with linked probes were ambiguous, the probe
identified persons at risk for symptoms of this disorder and demonstrated that a 
possible sporadic case of myotonic dystrophy was familial. In one of these
families the size of the unstable myotonic dystrophy-specific fragment decreased 
on transmission to offspring, who remained asymptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy is improved by the use of a
probe that detects directly the mutation responsible for this disorder.

Idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia--four patients with opportunistic infections
and no evidence of HIV infection.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1993 Feb 11;328(6):429-31.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We describe four patients without major risk factors for 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, each of whom presented with severe 
opportunistic infections and was found to have idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia.
We performed assays to detect the presence of retroviruses and undertook
immunophenotyping of subgroups of peripheral-blood lymphocytes.
RESULTS: The opportunistic infections at presentation included Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis (two patients, one with concurrent
pulmonary tuberculosis), and histoplasma-induced brain abscess. During 10 to 68
months of observation, none of the four patients had evidence of infection with
HIV type 1 or 2 or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I or II on the basis of
epidemiologic, serologic, or polymerase-chain-reaction studies or culture, nor
was there any detectable reverse transcriptase activity. Although all the
patients had severe, persistent CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia (range, 12 to 293 cells
per cubic millimeter), the CD4+ cell count progressively declined in only one and
was accompanied by multiple opportunistic infections. All four patients had
significantly reduced numbers of circulating CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, 
or B cells (or all three).
CONCLUSIONS: These four patients had idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia with
opportunistic infections but no evidence of HIV infection. Instead of the
progressive, selective depletion of CD4+ T cells characteristic of HIV infection,
some patients with idiopathic immunodeficiency have stable CD4+ cell counts
accompanied by reductions in the levels of several other lymphocyte subgroups.

BACKGROUND: Although patients with idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia and serious 
opportunistic infections have been described previously, the clinical and
immunologic features of this condition have not been well defined.
METHODS: We studied in detail five patients with idiopathic CD4+
T-lymphocytopenia. The studies included serologic testing, culture, and
polymerase chain reaction for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 
2, serologic testing for the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types I and
II, lymphocyte phenotyping, immunoglobulin quantitation, and
lymphocyte-transformation assays, as well as attempts to isolate a retroviral
agent. The results were compared with those in HIV-infected persons matched for
CD4+ T-cell counts and with those in normal controls. We also studied the spouses
of patients and the blood donors for one patient.
RESULTS: In these five patients, there was no evidence of either HIV or HTLV
infection. All the patients had both low percentages and low counts of CD4+ T
cells, with relative increases in percentages, but not counts, of CD8+ cells.
Numbers of B cells and natural killer cells were generally normal. As compared
with HIV-infected persons, our patients had lower percentages and counts of CD8+ 
cells and more lymphopenia. CD4+ counts were relatively stable over time. Instead
of the high immunoglobulin levels seen in HIV infection, these patients had
normal or slightly low levels of immunoglobulins. The lymphocyte-transformation
response to mitogens and antigens was depressed. Results in spouses and blood
donors were normal.
CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia differs from HIV infection in its 
immunologic characteristics and in its apparent lack of progression over time.
Nothing about the immunologic or viral-culture studies performed in these
patients or about their family members or blood donors suggests that a
transmissible agent causes this condition.

    N Engl J Med. 1993 May 13;328(19):1422-3.

BACKGROUND: Bacillary angiomatosis is characterized by vascular lesions, which
occur usually in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A
newly described gram-negative organism, Rochalimaea henselae, has been associated
with cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis, but no organism has been isolated and
cultivated directly from cutaneous tissue.
METHODS: We used two methods to isolate the infecting bacterium from four
HIV-infected patients with cutaneous lesions suggestive of bacillary
angiomatosis: cultivation with eukaryotic tissue-culture monolayers and direct
plating of homogenized tissue onto agar. The patients' blood was cultured with
the lysis-centrifugation method. Isolates recovered from skin and blood were
identified by sequencing all or part of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplified with
the polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: R. quintana, historically known as the agent of trench fever, was
isolated from cutaneous lesions in three patients, after tissue homogenates were 
cultivated with endothelial-cell monolayers; R. henselae was isolated from a
cutaneous lesion in one patient. In two patients, R. quintana was isolated from
both cutaneous tissue and blood; in one patient it was also isolated from bone.
CONCLUSIONS: In bacillary angiomatosis, either of two species of rochalimaea--R. 
quintana or R. henselae--can be isolated from cutaneous lesions or blood,
providing an additional method of diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Intracerebral transplantation of fetal dopaminergic neurons is a
promising new approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Patients with
parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) have 
a relatively stable lesion limited to the nigrostriatal system, rendering them
ideal candidates for transplantation. Improvement of motor function after neural 
grafting has previously been observed in nonhuman primates with MPTP-induced
parkinsonism.
METHODS: We grafted human fetal tissue from the ventral mesencephalon (obtained
six to eight weeks after conception) bilaterally to the caudate and putamen in
two immunosuppressed patients with severe MPTP-induced parkinsonism, using a
stereotaxic technique. The patients were assessed regularly with clinical rating 
scales, timed tests of motor performance, and [18F]fluorodopa positron-emission
tomography during the 18 months before the operation and the 22 to 24 months
after the operation.
RESULTS: Both patients had substantial, sustained improvement in motor function
and became much more independent. Postoperatively, the second patient's
maintenance dose of levodopa was decreased to 150 mg daily, which was 30 percent 
of the original dose. Striatal uptake of fluorodopa was unchanged 5 to 6 months
postoperatively but was markedly and bilaterally increased at 12 to 13 and 22 to 
24 months in both patients, closely paralleling the patients' clinical
improvement. There were no serious complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral implantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue can induce
substantial long-term functional improvement in patients with parkinsonism and
severe dopamine depletion and is accompanied by increased uptake of fluorodopa by
the striatum. The results in these patients resemble those obtained in
MPTP-treated primates and suggest that this will be a useful model for the
assessment of transplantation therapies in Parkinson's disease.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopamine
neurons that innervate the caudate and the putamen. Studies in animals suggest
that fetal dopaminergic neurons can survive transplantation and restore
neurologic function. This report compares the clinical results in four case
patients with severe Parkinson's disease who underwent stereotaxic implantation
of human fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue in one caudate nucleus with the
results in a control group of similar subjects assigned at random to a one-year
delay in surgery.
METHODS: Each case patient received cryopreserved tissue from one fetal cadaver
(gestational age, 7 to 11 weeks). Before implantation, adjacent midbrain tissue
underwent microbiologic, biochemical, and viability testing. Cyclosporine was
administered for six months postoperatively.
RESULTS: The procedure was well tolerated. Three case patients showed bilateral
improvement on motor tasks, as assessed on videotape, and were more functional in
the activities of daily living, as assessed by themselves and neurologists,
during both optimal drug therapy and "drug holiday" periods. One case patient,
who died after four months from continued disease progression, had striatonigral 
degeneration at autopsy. In the patients who received transplants, optimal
control was achieved with a lower dose of antiparkinsonian medications, whereas
the controls required more medication. Positron-emission tomography with
[18F]fluorodopa before and after surgery in one patient revealed a bilateral
restoration of caudate dopamine synthesis to the range of normal controls, but
continued bilateral deficits in the putamen.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the case patients continued to be disabled by their
disease, unilateral intracaudate grafts of fetal tissue containing dopamine
diminished the symptoms and signs of parkinsonism during 18 months of evaluation.

Food-dependent Cushing's syndrome mediated by aberrant adrenal sensitivity to
gastric inhibitory polypeptide.

BACKGROUND: Some patients with Cushing's syndrome have nodular adrenal
hyperplasia. In most the disease is corticotropin-dependent, but in others it is 
corticotropin-independent. The cause of the adrenal hyperplasia in the latter
patients is not known.
METHODS: We studied a 49-year-old woman with Cushing's syndrome and nodular
adrenal hyperplasia in whom food stimulated cortisol secretion. Plasma cortisol
concentrations were measured in response to the ingestion of mixed meals,
glucose, protein, and fat and after the administration of various
gastrointestinal and other types of hormones. We also studied the ability of the 
long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide to prevent the food-induced increase
in plasma cortisol concentrations and to ameliorate the clinical manifestations
of Cushing's syndrome in this patient.
RESULTS: The patient's fasting plasma cortisol concentrations were subnormal,
ranging from 3.0 to 7.5 micrograms per deciliter (83 to 207 nmol per liter), and 
they increased to as high as 16.5 micrograms per deciliter (455 nmol per liter)
after a mixed meal. Her urinary cortisol excretion ranged from 164 to 250
micrograms per day (453 to 690 nmol per day) and could not be suppressed by a
large dose of dexamethasone. Plasma corticotropin concentrations were virtually
undetectable at all times. The ingestion of glucose, protein, and fat increased
plasma cortisol concentrations to 3.6, 2.2, and 4 times the base-line value,
respectively; the meal-induced and glucose-induced increases were inhibited by
octreotide. The infusion of gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) increased the
patient's plasma cortisol concentration to 3.7 times the base-line value, but had
no effect in normal subjects. The patient's fasting plasma GIP concentrations
were normal both before and after a meal, and there was a close correlation
between her plasma cortisol and GIP concentrations. Treatment with octreotide
decreased urinary cortisol excretion and ameliorated the clinical manifestations 
of Cushing's syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of aberrant adrenal sensitivity to GIP can result in
food-dependent adrenal hyperplasia and therefore in Cushing's syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-independent nodular adrenal hyperplasia is a rare cause
of Cushing's syndrome, and the factors responsible for the adrenal hyperplasia
are not known.
METHODS: We studied a 48-year-old woman with Cushing's syndrome, nodular adrenal 
hyperplasia, and undetectable plasma corticotropin concentrations in whom food
stimulated cortisol secretion.
RESULTS: Cortisol secretion had an inverse diurnal rhythm in this patient, with
low-to-normal fasting plasma cortisol concentrations and elevated postprandial
cortisol concentrations that could not be suppressed with dexamethasone. The
cortisol concentrations increased in response to oral glucose (4-fold increase)
and a lipid-rich meal (4.8-fold increase) or a protein-rich meal (2.6-fold
increase), but not intravenous glucose. The infusion of somatostatin blunted the 
plasma cortisol response to oral glucose. Intravenous infusion of gastric
inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) for one hour increased the plasma cortisol
concentration in the patient but not in four normal subjects. Fasting plasma GIP 
concentrations in the patient were similar to those in the normal subjects;
feeding the patient test meals induced increases in plasma GIP concentrations
that paralleled those in plasma cortisol concentrations. Cell suspensions of
adrenal tissue from the patient produced more cortisol when stimulated by GIP
than when stimulated by corticotropin. In contrast, adrenal cells from normal
adults and fetuses or patients with cortisol-producting or aldosterone-producing 
adenomas responded to corticotropin but not to GIP.
CONCLUSIONS: Nodular adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing's syndrome may be
food-dependent as a result of abnormal responsiveness of adrenal cells to
physiologic secretion of GIP. "Illicit" (ectopic) expression of GIP receptors on 
adrenal cells presumably underlies this disorder.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a common, severe autosomal recessive disease
caused in a majority of cases by a three-nucleotide deletion (delta F508) in the 
cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene. Current methods of prenatal
diagnosis involve chorionic-villus sampling or amniocentesis. In vitro
fertilization and diagnosis during embryonic development before implantation
would allow only unaffected embryos to be selected for transfer to the uterus,
thereby avoiding the need to terminate a pregnancy.
METHODS: Preimplantation diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was attempted in the cases 
of three couples, both members of which carried the delta F508 deletion. In vitro
fertilization techniques were used to recover oocytes from each woman and
fertilize them with her husband's sperm. Three days after insemination, embryos
in the cleavage stage underwent biopsy and removal of one or two cells for DNA
amplification and analysis.
RESULTS: Only two oocytes from one woman were fertilized normally; DNA analysis
of one of the embryos failed and cystic fibrosis was diagnosed in the other
(i.e., it was homozygous for delta F508), so neither was transferred. The oocytes
of each of the other two women produced noncarrier, carrier, and affected
embryos. Both couples chose to have one noncarrier embryo and one carrier embryo 
transferred. One woman became pregnant and gave birth to a girl free of the
deletion in both chromosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Preimplantation diagnosis of the delta F508 deletion causing cystic 
fibrosis is possible through in vitro fertilization, biopsy of a cleavage-stage
embryo, and amplification of DNA from single embryonic cells. This approach
should be equally applicable to other single-gene diseases in which the defect
has been identified. Analysis of a series of pregnancies, however, will be
required to assess the method adequately.

BACKGROUND: An infusion of prostaglandin E1 is widely used to maintain patency of
the ductus arteriosus in neonates with congenital heart disease. After
gastric-outlet obstruction was recognized in several infants who received
prostaglandin E1, we studied the association between the drug and this
complication.
METHODS: We evaluated all neonates who received prostaglandin E1 in our hospital 
between October 1, 1989, and September 30, 1991, for clinical, radiologic, or
pathological evidence of acute gastric-outlet obstruction.
RESULTS: Of the 74 neonates evaluated, 65 had no signs of gastric obstruction and
were considered normal; 5 had clinical and radiologic or pathological evidence of
gastric obstruction consistent with the presence of antral mucosal hyperplasia.
The remaining four neonates had clinical signs of gastric obstruction, but no
radiologic or pathological examinations were performed. The 5 neonates with
antral hyperplasia had received prostaglandin E1 for longer periods (mean [+/-
SD] duration, 569 +/- 341 hours) than the 65 normal neonates (54 +/- 58 hours, P 
less than 0.001) or the 4 neonates with clinical signs of gastric obstruction
(119 +/- 60 hours, P less than 0.05). The cumulative dose of prostaglandin E1 was
higher in the neonates with antral hyperplasia (2982 +/- 1392 micrograms per
kilogram of body weight) than in the normal neonates (279 +/- 270 micrograms per 
kilogram, P less than 0.001) or the neonates with signs of gastric obstruction
(528 +/- 306 micrograms per kilogram, P less than 0.01). In two neonates with
antral hyperplasia, the cessation of therapy lessened the gastric-outlet
obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: The administration of prostaglandin E1 to neonates can cause
gastric-outlet obstruction due to antral hyperplasia. Neonates who receive
prostaglandin E1 at recommended doses for more than 120 hours should be closely
monitored for evidence of antral hyperplasia.

BACKGROUND: Silent myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary atherosclerosis 
is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiac events, including sudden 
death. The relation between silent ischemia and the initiation of potentially
fatal ventricular arrhythmias has not been defined, however.
METHODS: As part of a long-term study of sudden cardiac death, data on
arrhythmias, coronary anatomy, and responses to ergonovine testing to provoke
coronary-artery spasm were collected prospectively among survivors of
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who had no flow-limiting coronary-artery lesions, 
prior myocardial infarctions, or other structural causes of cardiac arrest and no
angina pectoris. Associations between silent myocardial ischemia due to
coronary-artery spasm and the occurrence and characteristics of life-threatening 
ventricular arrhythmias were studied by both invasive and noninvasive techniques.
RESULTS: Silent ischemic events were associated with the initiation of
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in five patients with induced or
spontaneous focal coronary-artery spasm (or both). These patients were identified
among a group of 356 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were
evaluated between 1980 and 1991. In two of the five patients reperfusion, rather 
than ischemia itself, correlated with the onset of the ventricular arrhythmia.
Only one of the five had an inducible arrhythmia during electrophysiologic
testing. Titration of the dose of a calcium-entry-blocking agent (verapamil,
diltiazem, or nifedipine) against the ability of ergonovine to provoke spasm was 
successful in preventing both the provocation of spasm and arrhythmias in all
four patients who were tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Silent myocardial ischemia due to coronary-artery spasm can initiate
potentially fatal arrhythmias in patients without flow-limiting structural
coronary-artery lesions. The role of silent ischemia, reperfusion, or both in the
initiation of fatal arrhythmias in larger groups of patients with advanced
coronary-artery lesions remains to be defined.

    N Engl J Med. 1992 Oct 29;327(18):1321-2.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Most hemangiomas are small, harmless birthmarks that
appear soon after birth, proliferate for 8 to 18 months, and then slowly regress 
over the next 5 to 8 years, leaving normal or slightly blemished skin. In rare
cases, hemangiomas can endanger vital structures, with a mortality of up to 60
percent. About a third of these life-threatening hemangiomas respond to treatment
with corticosteroids, but for the others there is no safe and effective
treatment. We evaluated the effects of daily subcutaneous injections of
interferon alfa-2a (up to 3 million units per square meter of body-surface area) 
in 20 neonates and infants with life-threatening or vision-threatening
hemangiomas that failed to respond to corticosteroid therapy.
RESULTS: In 18 of the 20 patients the hemangiomas regressed by 50 percent or more
after an average of 7.8 months of treatment (range, 2 to 13). One infant died of 
refractory proliferation of a lesion and consumptive coagulopathy. The condition 
of three other patients who had large hemangiomas associated with consumptive
coagulopathies that were unresponsive to conventional therapies stabilized after 
seven days of treatment with interferon alfa-2a alone. Transient side effects of 
treatment with interferon alfa-2a included fever, neutropenia (one patient), and 
skin necrosis (one patient). No long-term toxicity has been observed after a mean
follow-up of 16 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Interferon alfa-2a appears to induce the early regression of
life-threatening corticosteroid-resistant hemangiomas of infancy.

BACKGROUND: Acquired mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene have been
detected in several human cancers, including colon, breast, and lung cancer.
Inherited mutations (transmitted through the germline) of this gene can underlie 
the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare familial association of breast cancer in young
women, childhood sarcomas, and other malignant neoplasms. We investigated the
possibility that p53 mutations in the germline are associated with second primary
cancers that arise in children and young adults who would not be considered as
belonging to Li-Fraumeni families.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the blood leukocytes of 59 children and
young adults with a second primary cancer. The polymerase chain reaction, in
combination with denaturant-gel electrophoresis and sequencing, was used to
identify p53 gene mutations.
RESULTS: Mutations of p53 that changed the predicted amino acid sequence were
identified in leukocyte DNA from 4 of the 59 patients (6.8 percent). In three
cases, the mutations were identical to ones previously found in the p53 gene. The
fourth mutation was the first germline mutation to be identified in exon 9, at
codon 325. Analysis of leukocyte DNA from close relatives of three of the
patients indicated that the mutations were inherited, but cancer had developed in
only one parent at the start of the study.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify an important subgroup of young patients with
cancer who carry germline mutations in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene but whose
family histories are not indicative of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The early
detection of such mutations would be useful not only in treating these patients, 
but also in identifying family members who may be at high risk for the
development of tumors.

    N Engl J Med. 1992 May 14;326(20):1350-2.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies have identified germline mutations of the p53
tumor-suppressor gene in families with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited
disorder characterized by a high risk of sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, breast
cancer, and other tumors. In this report, we address the possibility that some
sporadic sarcomas may be associated with new germline mutations of the p53 gene, 
which would not be manifested as familial cancer unless the patient survived to
reproduce.
METHODS: We studied DNA from peripheral leukocytes of 196 patients with sarcoma
and from 200 controls. Of the 196 patients with sarcoma, 15 were selected because
they had had multiple primary cancers or had a family history of cancer. The
entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the p53 gene were analyzed for
mutations.
RESULTS: Eight germline mutations were found, three in patients with no known
family history of cancer and five in patients with an unusual personal or family 
history of cancer. Four mutations caused amino acid substitutions, and four
caused stop codons. These mutations were not present in any of the 200 controls.
CONCLUSIONS: New germline mutations of the p53 gene are rare among patients with 
"sporadic" sarcoma but may be common in patients with sarcoma whose background
includes either multiple primary cancers or a family history of cancer. Diverse
mutations of this gene were associated with an increased likelihood of cancer;
hence, the entire gene should be considered a target for heritable mutation. It
appears that the group of patients with cancer who carry germline mutations of
the p53 gene is more diverse than is suggested by the clinical definition of the 
Li-Fraumeni syndrome. The identification of carriers could be of substantial
clinical importance.

    N Engl J Med. 1992 Apr 30;326(18):1213-5.

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D has been added to milk in the United States since the 1930s
to prevent rickets. We report the unusual occurrence of eight cases of vitamin D 
intoxication that appear to have been caused by excessive vitamin D fortification
of dairy milk.
METHODS: Medical records were reviewed and a dietary questionnaire was sent to
eight patients who had unexplained hypervitaminosis D. Vitamin D analyses with
high-performance liquid chromatography were performed on samples of the patients'
serum, the dairy milk they drank, and the vitamin D concentrate added to the
milk.
RESULTS: All eight patients drank milk produced by a local dairy in amounts
ranging from 1/2 to 3 cups (118 to 710 ml) daily. All had elevated serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (mean [+/- SD], 731 +/- 434 nmol per liter
[293 +/- 174 ng per milliliter]). Six of the eight patients had elevated serum
vitamin D3 concentrations. Of the eight patients, seven had hypercalcemia and one
had hypercalciuria but normocalcemia (mean serum calcium, 3.14 +/- 0.51 mmol per 
liter [12.6 +/- 2.1 mg per deciliter]). Analysis of the dairy's vitamin
D-fortified milk revealed concentrations of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) that
ranged from undetectable to as high as 232,565 IU per quart (245,840 IU per
liter). An analysis of the concentrate that was used to fortify the milk, labeled
as containing vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), revealed that it contained vitamin D3.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypervitaminosis D may result from drinking milk that is incorrectly
and excessively fortified with vitamin D. Milk that is fortified with vitamin D
must be carefully monitored.

Hodgkin's disease, lymphomatoid papulosis, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma derived 
from a common T-cell clone.

Davis TH(1), Morton CC, Miller-Cassman R, Balk SP, Kadin ME.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.

BACKGROUND: Lymphomatoid papulosis is a benign cutaneous eruption that in 10 to
20 percent of patients is associated with the development of lymphoma. The
atypical cells of lymphomatoid papulosis histologically resemble the malignant
cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or the Reed-Sternberg cells of Hodgkin's
disease. We studied a patient in whom lymphomatoid papulosis developed in 1971,
Hodgkin's disease in 1975, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 1985, to determine
whether these diseases are clonally related.
METHODS: The T-cell-receptor alpha-chain gene was cloned and sequenced from a
cell line derived from the advanced-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and the
polymerase chain reaction was used to search for this rearrangement of the
alpha-chain gene in tissues obtained earlier that were affected by Hodgkin's
disease or lymphomatoid papulosis.
RESULTS: The tumor-specific rearrangement of the alpha-chain gene was detected in
the patient's earlier tissues affected by lymphomatoid papulosis and Hodgkin's
disease, but not in control tissue, including uninvolved tissues from the staging
laparotomy for Hodgkin's disease. Cytogenetic studies revealed a translocation,
t(8;9)(p22;p24), in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma lines and in a dermatopathic lymph 
node removed two years before the clinical onset of the cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma. Immunohistochemical findings were consistent with an activated T-cell
phenotype for the atypical cells of lymphomatoid papulosis, the Reed-Sternberg
cells of Hodgkin's disease, and the malignant cells of the T-cell lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphomatoid papulosis, Hodgkin's disease, and cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma can be derived from a single T-cell clone. A t(8;9) genetic
translocation may be involved in the pathogenesis of lymphomatoid papulosis or
its progression to malignant disease.

Parainfluenza virus respiratory infection after bone marrow transplantation.

Wendt CH(1), Weisdorf DJ, Jordan MC, Balfour HH Jr, Hertz MI.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota Medical School,
Minneapolis.

BACKGROUND: Pneumonia complicates about half of all bone marrow transplantations,
and in about a third of the cases no specific cause is identified. Although
parainfluenza virus is a common cause of respiratory infection in normal
children, its role in transplant recipients is unknown.
METHODS: We describe the incidence and clinical course of parainfluenza infection
among the 1253 recipients of bone marrow transplants at our center from 1974
through 1990. We performed viral cultures on all such recipients who had
manifestations of a viral infection or fever without apparent cause.
RESULTS: Among the 1253 patients, we found 27 (2.2 percent) who had parainfluenza
virus infection as demonstrated by culture (12 of 580 adults and 15 of 673
children). Eight of these patients had only upper respiratory tract involvement, 
all of whom had positive nasopharyngeal cultures. Of the remaining 19, 8 had
symptoms of both upper and lower respiratory tract involvement, and 11 had only
lower respiratory involvement, of whom only 6 had positive nasopharyngeal
cultures. Four required bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis. A median of nine
days elapsed from the onset of symptoms until the culture became positive, and
overall only 33 of 118 cultures obtained were positive. Respiratory failure
developed in 6 of the 19 patients with lower respiratory tract involvement, and
all died.
CONCLUSIONS: Parainfluenza virus is a cause of serious lower respiratory tract
involvement in both adults and children who undergo bone marrow transplantation. 
Given the insensitivity of current culturing techniques, it may be
underdiagnosed.

    N Engl J Med. 1992 Aug 20;327(8):564-5.

BACKGROUND: Since 1985, donors of organs or tissues for transplantation in the
United States have been screened for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),
and more than 60,000 organs and 1 million tissues have been transplanted. We
describe a case of transmission of HIV-1 by transplantation of organs and tissues
procured between the time the donor became infected and the appearance of
antibodies. The donor was a 22-year-old man who died 32 hours after a gunshot
wound; he had no known risk factors for HIV-1 infection and was seronegative.
METHODS: We reviewed the processing and distribution of all the transplanted
organs and tissues, reviewed the medical histories of the donor and
HIV-1-infected recipients, tested stored donor lymphocytes for HIV-1 by viral
culture and the polymerase chain reaction, and tested stored serum samples from
four organ recipients for HIV-1 antigen and antibody.
RESULTS: HIV-1 was detected in cultured lymphocytes from the donor. Of 58 tissues
and organs obtained from the donor, 52 could be accounted for by the hospitals
that received them. Of the 48 identified recipients, 41 were tested for HIV-1
antibody. All four recipients of organs and all three recipients of unprocessed
fresh-frozen bone were infected with HIV-1. However, 34 recipients of other
tissues--2 receiving corneas, 3 receiving lyophilized soft tissue, 25 receiving
ethanol-treated bone, 3 receiving dura mater treated with gamma radiation, and 1 
receiving marrow-evacuated, fresh-frozen bone--tested negative for HIV-1
antibody. Despite immunosuppressive chemotherapy, HIV-1 antibody appeared between
26 and 54 days after transplantation in the three organ recipients who survived
more than four weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, transmission of HIV-1 by seronegative organ and
tissue donors can occur. Improvements in the methods used to screen donors for
HIV-1, advances in techniques of virus inactivation, prompt reporting of HIV
infection in recipients, and accurate accounting of distributed allografts would 
help to reduce further this already exceedingly low risk.

Activating mutations of the stimulatory G protein in the McCune-Albright
syndrome.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1991 Dec 12;325(24):1738-40.

BACKGROUND: The McCune-Albright syndrome is a sporadic disease characterized by
polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café au lait spots, sexual precocity, and
hyperfunction of multiple endocrine glands. These manifestations may be explained
by a somatic mutation in affected tissues that results in activation of the
signal-transduction pathway generating cyclic AMP (cAMP). We analyzed DNA from
tissues of patients with the McCune-Albright syndrome for the presence of
activating mutations of the gene for the alpha subunit of the G protein (Gs
alpha) that stimulates cAMP formation.
METHODS: Genomic DNA fragments encompassing regions (exons 8 and 9) previously
found to contain activating missense mutations of the Gs alpha gene (gsp
mutations) in sporadically occurring pituitary tumors were amplified in tissues
from four patients with the McCune-Albright syndrome by the polymerase chain
reaction. The amplified DNA was analyzed for mutations by denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization.
RESULTS: We detected one of two activating mutations within exon 8 of the Gs
alpha gene in tissues from all four patients, including affected endocrine organs
(gonads, adrenal glands, thyroid, and pituitary) and tissues not classically
involved in the McCune-Albright syndrome. In two of the patients, histidine was
substituted for arginine at position 201 of Gs alpha, and in the other two
patients cysteine was substituted for the same arginine residue. In each patient 
the proportion of cells affected varied from tissue to tissue. In two endocrine
organs, the highest proportion of mutant alleles was found in regions of abnormal
cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations within exon 8 of the Gs alpha gene that result in
increased activity of the Gs protein and increased cAMP formation are present in 
various tissues of patients with the McCune-Albright syndrome. Somatic mutation
of this gene early in embryogenesis could result in the mosaic population of
normal and mutant-bearing tissues that may underlie the clinical manifestations
of this disease.

A look-back investigation of patients of an HIV-infected physician. Public health
implications.

BACKGROUND: Transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to five
patients receiving care from an HIV-infected dentist in Florida has recently been
reported. Current data indicate that the risk of HIV transmission from health
care workers to patients is low. Despite this low risk, programs to notify
patients of past exposure to an HIV-infected health care worker are being
conducted with increasing frequency.
METHODS: We recently conducted an investigation of all the patients cared for by 
an HIV-infected family physician during a period when he had severe dermatitis
caused by Mycobacterium marinum on his hands and forearms. After reviewing the
patients' records, we notified 336 patients who had undergone one or more
procedures (digital examination of a body cavity or vaginal delivery) placing
them at potentially increased risk of HIV infection. The patients were offered
tests for HIV infection and counseling.
RESULTS: Of the 336 patients, 325 (97 percent) had negative tests for HIV
antibody, 3 (1 percent) refused testing, 1 (less than 1 percent) died of a cause 
unrelated to HIV infection before notification, and the HIV-antibody status of 7 
(2 percent) remained unknown. The direct and indirect public health costs of this
investigation were approximately $130,000.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation raise important questions about
the risk of HIV transmission from health care workers to patients and the
usefulness of HIV look-back programs, particularly in the light of recently
published recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control. We propose that
before a look-back investigation is undertaken, there should be a clearly
identifiable risk of transmission of the infection, substantially higher than the
risk requiring limitation of an HIV-infected health care worker's practice
prospectively.

BACKGROUND: The syndrome of progressive muscular atrophy decades after acute
paralytic poliomyelitis (post-polio syndrome) is not well understood. The theory 
that physiologic changes and aging cause the new weakness does not explain the
immunologic abnormalities reported in some patients. An alternative explanation
is persistent or recurrent poliovirus infection.
METHODS: We assessed the intrathecal antibody response to poliovirus and
intrathecal production of interleukin-2 and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in 36
patients with the post-polio syndrome and 67 controls (including 13 who had had
poliomyelitis but had no new symptoms and 18 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
Intrathecal antibody responses to measles, mumps, herpes simplex, and varicella
zoster viruses were also determined.
RESULTS: Oligoclonal IgM bands specific to poliovirus were detected in the
cerebrospinal fluid of 21 of the 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome (58
percent) but in none of the control group (P less than 0.0001). In quantitative
studies there was evidence of increased intrathecal synthesis of IgM antibodies
to poliovirus only among the patients with the post-polio syndrome; there was no 
increased synthesis of IgM to measles, mumps, herpes simplex, or varicella zoster
viruses. The patients with post-polio syndrome had significantly higher mean (+/-
SD) (cerebrospinal fluid levels of interleukin-2 and soluble interleukin-2
receptors than the controls (8.1 +/- 5.3 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.8 U per milliliter and
159.6 +/- 102.9 vs. 10.7 +/- 6.2 U per milliliter, respectively). The intrathecal
synthesis of IgM antibodies to poliovirus correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid
concentrations of interleukin-2 (P less than 0.0005) and soluble interleukin-2
receptors (P less than 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: An intrathecal immune response against poliovirus is present in many
patients with the post-polio syndrome. In some of these patients the
recrudescence of muscle weakness may be caused by persistent or recurrent
infection of neural cells with the poliovirus.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Nephrolithiasis may occur as a consequence of a number of
hereditary disorders. We describe a large kindred from northern New York with
hereditary nephrolithiasis accompanied by urinary concentrating defects,
nephrocalcinosis, renal insufficiency, and renal wasting of potassium, phosphate,
calcium, and uric acid. The pattern of inheritance was established by examining
the patients and their records and interviewing family members. Selected members 
of the family were evaluated in detail, with measurements of erythrocyte cation
fluxes and carbonic anhydrase (carbonate dehydratase) activity.
RESULTS: The kindred consisted of 162 family members from six generations. All
nine affected persons were male and appeared to have inherited the disease from
their mothers. No affected man transmitted the gene to a son, but the daughters
of affected men were carriers. The patients presented in childhood with calcium
nephrolithiasis and proteinuria, with progression to nephrocalcinosis, urinary
concentrating defects, and renal insufficiency. Renal biopsies revealed tubular
atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis; the characteristic
features of other forms of hereditary nephritis were absent. Abnormalities in the
renal excretion of calcium, phosphate, potassium, and uric acid were found only
in the adult members of the kindred, although renal biopsies were abnormal even
in younger members. In one patient who has had a renal transplant for seven
years, the disease has not recurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This kindred manifested an X-linked recessive nephrolithiasis with
renal failure, a new form of hereditary renal disease. Most of the identifiable
physiologic abnormalities occurred after the development of nephrolithiasis and
renal insufficiency and may not be of pathogenetic importance.

BACKGROUND: Primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)
frequently causes an acute, self-limited viral syndrome. To examine the relations
among viral replication, the immune response of the host, and clinical illness
during this initial phase of infection, we undertook a quantitative, molecular,
and biologic analysis of infectious HIV-1 in the blood and plasma of three
patients with symptomatic primary infection and of a sexual partner of one of
them.
METHODS: During an eight-week period of primary infection, HIV-1 was cultured
frequently in dilutions of plasma and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), 
and levels of HIV-1 antigen and antibody were determined sequentially by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. Replication-competent HIV-1
proviruses were cloned and characterized biologically.
RESULTS: Six to 15 days after the onset of symptoms, high titers of infectious
HIV-1 (from 10 to 10(3) tissue-culture-infective doses per milliliter of plasma) 
and viral p24 antigen were detected in the plasma of all three patients. These
titers fell precipitously by day 27, and the decline coincided with an increase
in the levels of antiviral antibodies and the resolution of symptoms. Sequential 
isolates of virus from plasma and PBMC obtained throughout the period of primary 
infection, as well as virus derived from two molecular proviral clones, were
highly cytopathic for normal-donor PBMC and immortalized T cells, despite the
marked reduction in the titers of virus in plasma.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary, symptomatic HIV-1 infection is associated with high titers 
of cytopathic, replication-competent viral strains, and during such infection
potential infectivity is enhanced. Effective control of HIV-1 replication during 
primary infection implies the activation of clinically important mechanisms of
immune defense that merit further examination in relation to the development of
antiviral therapy and vaccines.

Transient high levels of viremia in patients with primary human immunodeficiency 
virus type 1 infection.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1991 Sep 5;325(10):733-5.

BACKGROUND: The rapidly evolving clinical picture of primary infection with the
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) suggests that a better understanding 
of the kinetics of viral replication in vivo during the short period before
seroconversion may provide insight into the pathogenesis of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Titers of infectious HIV-1 were determined by
end-point-dilution culture in sequential samples of plasma and peripheral-blood
mononuclear cells from four patients with primary infection, with peak titers of 
1000 to 10,000 tissue-culture-infective doses per milliliter of plasma and 100 to
10,000 infective doses per 10(6) peripheral-blood mononuclear cells. The high
viral burden in mononuclear cells was confirmed by quantitative studies using a
polymerase-chain-reaction method. In as little as 10 days, the high HIV-1 load in
both plasma and cells decreased spontaneously and precipitously, at least
100-fold, in all four patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although p24 core antigenemia and viral isolation have previously
been described during primary HIV-1 infection, this report documents the large
viral burden during the acute phase of infection. The rapid and spontaneous
decline in the viral load suggests an effective immune response in the host that,
if understood, may be used to combat AIDS.

(1)Neuromuscular Research Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1991 Aug 22;325(8):587-8.

BACKGROUND: The invasion and destruction of nonnecrotic muscle fibers by CD8+
cytotoxic T cells is considered a hallmark of polymyositis. In the cases of
polymyositis reported so far, the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells expressed the common 
form of T-cell receptor for the recognition of antigen, the so-called alpha/beta 
T-cell receptor. We describe a 69-year-old man with polymyositis mediated by
CD4-, CD8- T cells expressing the recently discovered, uncommon gamma/delta
T-cell receptor.
METHODS: We used immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase techniques to study
frozen sections of muscle from our patient, who had mild weakness of cervical and
proximal limb muscles, and from control patients with polymyositis,
inclusion-body myositis, dermatomyositis, or granulomatous myopathy with
monoclonal antibodies against T-cell-related antigens (CD2, CD3, CD4, CD8, and
gamma/delta T-cell receptor), B cells (CD22), major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) and MHC-related antigens (MHC Class I, CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c), and the 65-kd
heat-shock protein. The membrane contacts between the autoinvasive cells and the 
sarcolemma were investigated by electron microscopy.
RESULTS: In the patient described here, but not in 28 others with inflammatory
myopathies, myriad gamma/delta T cells surrounded and invaded nonnecrotic muscle 
fibers. All muscle fibers were highly reactive for MHC Class I antigen and the
65-kd heat-shock protein. Treatment with prednisone improved the clinical and
histologic findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymyositis can be mediated by gamma/delta T cells. This new form
of polymyositis appears to be highly responsive to steroids.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1991 Aug 1;325(5):354-7.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Symptomatic pulmonary aspergillosis has rarely been
reported in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We
describe the predisposing factors, the clinical and radiologic features, and the 
therapeutic outcomes in 13 patients with pulmonary aspergillosis, all of whom had
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and 12 of whom had AIDS.
RESULTS: Pulmonary aspergillosis was detected a median of 25 months after the
diagnosis of AIDS, usually following corticosteroid use, neutropenia, pneumonia
due to other pathogens, marijuana smoking, or the use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics. Two major patterns of disease were observed: invasive aspergillosis 
(in 10 patients) and obstructing bronchial aspergillosis (in 3). Cough and fever,
the most common symptoms, tended to be insidious in onset in patients with
invasive disease (median duration, 1.3 months before diagnosis). Breathlessness, 
cough, and chest pain predominated in the three patients with obstructing
bronchial aspergillosis, who coughed up fungal casts. Radiologic patterns
included upper-lobe cavitary disease (sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis),
nodules, pleural-based lesions, and diffuse infiltrates, usually of the lower
lobe. Transbronchial biopsies were usually negative, but positive cultures were
obtained from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid or percutaneous aspirates.
Dissemination to other organs occurred in at least two patients, and direct
invasion of extrapulmonary sites was seen in two others. The results of treatment
with amphotericin B, itraconazole, or both were variable. Ten of the patients
died a median of 3 months after the diagnosis (range, 0 to 12 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary aspergillosis is a possible late complication of AIDS; if 
diagnosed early, it may be treated successfully.

    N Engl J Med. 1991 Feb 21;324(8):556-8.

BACKGROUND: Transient polyuria and polydipsia during pregnancy are rare, and
their cause is not entirely clear. Possible explanations include the exacerbation
of preexisting abnormalities in the secretion or action of vasopressin and
abnormally large increases in plasma vasopressinase activity.
METHODS: We studied two women in whom overt polyuria and polydipsia developed
during the third trimester of pregnancy and disappeared after delivery. The
secretion and action of vasopressin were studied both when the women had polyuria
and polydipsia and later, when their water intake and urine volume were normal.
RESULTS: One patient had partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. She had little
increase in urine osmolality in response to water deprivation, hypertonic-saline 
infusion, and vasopressin injection and no response to desmopressin acetate
(1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin) during the immediate postpartum period. Her 
basal and stimulated plasma vasopressin concentrations were high (16.5 to 203.4
pmol per liter) before and during hypertonic-saline infusion 30 months post
partum. The other patient had partial neurogenic diabetes insipidus. She had
subnormal basal plasma vasopressin concentrations, a subnormal increase in the
plasma vasopressin level and a subnormal decrease in urine flow in response to
the administration of vasopressin, and a normal response to desmopressin. After
pregnancy, when her urine volume was normal, she had no increase in plasma
vasopressin in response to hypertonic-saline infusion, but she had a normal rise 
in the plasma vasopressin level and a normal renal response to vasopressin
administration.
CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy may unmask subclinical forms of both nephrogenic and
neurogenic diabetes insipidus. This exacerbation may result from both increased
vasopressinase activity and diminished renal responsiveness to vasopressin.

Syncytial giant-cell hepatitis. Sporadic hepatitis with distinctive pathological 
features, a severe clinical course, and paramyxoviral features.

Superina RA, Greig PD, Cameron R, et al.

Author information:

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We describe a new form of hepatitis, occurring in 10
patients over a period of six years, characterized clinically by manifestations
of severe hepatitis, histologically by large syncytial giant hepatocytes, and
ultrastructurally by intracytoplasmic structures consistent with paramyxoviral
nucleocapsids.
RESULTS: The patients ranged in age from 5 months to 41 years. The tentative
clinical diagnosis before biopsy was non-A, non-B hepatitis in five patients and 
autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in the others. Five patients underwent liver 
transplantation; the others died. The diagnosis of syncytial giant-cell hepatitis
was established pathologically. The liver cords were replaced in all 10 patients 
by syncytial giant cells with up to 30 nuclei. In 8 of the 10 the cytoplasm
contained pleomorphic particles of 150 to 250 microns, filamentous strands, and
particles of 14 to 17 nm with peripherally disposed spikes resembling
paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. Structures resembling degenerated forms were found
in the other two patients. One of two chimpanzees injected with a liver
homogenate from the index patient had an increase in the titer of paramyxoviral
antibodies, probably an anamnestic reaction to previous paramyxoviral infection, 
suggesting that a paramyxoviral antigen but not viable virus was present in the
liver homogenate.
CONCLUSIONS: Although further virologic studies will be required for precise
classification, we believe that paramyxoviruses should be considered in patients 
with severe sporadic hepatitis.

Unexplained rabies in three immigrants in the United States. A virologic
investigation.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1991 Jun 27;324(26):1890-1.

BACKGROUND: Extensive investigation of three patients who died of rabies in the
United States failed to reveal any source of exposure to the disease. The three
patients had immigrated to the United States from areas in Laos, the Philippines,
and Mexico where rabies is endemic.
METHODS: We studied rabies viruses isolated from the three patients, other
patients with a known source of exposure, and animals in the United States,
Thailand (as a proxy for Laos), the Philippines, and Mexico. The viruses were
characterized by indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests according
to their reactions to panels of monoclonal antibodies. Transcribed complementary 
DNA from these isolates was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction; the DNA
product was then analyzed by differential digestion with restriction enzymes.
RESULTS: The viral isolate from each of the three patients was a rabies variant
with distinctive antigenic or genetic characteristics. For each of the three
isolates, identical variants were found in specimens from rabid animals obtained 
from or near the country in which the patient lived before immigrating to the
United States. None of these variants were found among the isolates collected
from rabid animals in the United States.
CONCLUSIONS: Rabies infection in these three patients did not originate in the
United States but resulted from exposures in Laos, the Philippines, and Mexico.
Since the three patients had lived in the United States for 4 years, 6 years, and
11 months, our findings suggest that the onset of the clinical manifestations of 
rabies occurred after long incubation periods.

Paraneoplastic pemphigus. An autoimmune mucocutaneous disease associated with
neoplasia.

3rd, Mutasim D, Ariss-Abdo L, et al.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Johns Hopkins University, School of Medicine,
Baltimore, MD 21205.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We describe five patients with underlying neoplasms in
whom painful mucosal ulcerations and polymorphous skin lesions developed, usually
with progression to blistering eruptions on the trunk and extremities. Histologic
examination showed vacuolization of epidermal basal cells, keratinocyte necrosis,
and acantholysis. Immunofluorescence testing revealed atypical pemphigus-like
autoantibodies in perilesional epithelium and serum from all five patients. We
studied the antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies by indirect
immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using extracts of 14C-labeled human
keratinocytes. IgG purified from the serum of one patient was passively
transferred to four neonatal mice to test for pathogenicity.
RESULTS: Immunofluorescence testing showed that the autoantibodies bound to the
surface of tissues containing desmosomes, including complex and simple epithelia,
and myocardium. An identical and unique complex of four polypeptides with
molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 was immunoprecipitated by all serum
samples. The 250-kd polypeptide comigrated with desmoplakin I (a protein found in
the desmosomes of all epithelia), and the 230-kd antigen comigrated with the
antigen of bullous pemphigoid. Cutaneous blisters, a positive Nikolsky's sign,
and epidermal and esophageal acantholysis developed in all mice into which the
autoantibody was injected. Electron microscopy showed epidermal acantholysis
similar to lesions of experimentally induced pemphigus vulgaris.
CONCLUSION: These five patients with cancer had a novel acantholytic
mucocutaneous disease characterized by autoantibodies that were pathogenic after 
passive transfer. The autoantibodies from these patients reacted with an antigen 
complex composed of desmoplakin I and the 230-kd antigen of bullous pemphigoid
and two as yet unidentified epithelial antigens. We suggest the term
"paraneoplastic pemphigus" for this disease.

A newly recognized fastidious gram-negative pathogen as a cause of fever and
bacteremia.

(1)Department of Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, College
of Medicine, Oklahoma City.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1990 Dec 6;323(23):1625-7.

BACKGROUND: We identified a motile, curved, gram-negative bacillus as the cause
of persistent fever and bacteremia in two patients with symptomatic human
immunodeficiency virus infection. The same organism was subsequently recovered
from a bone marrow-transplant recipient with septicemia and from two
immunocompetent persons with week-long febrile illnesses. All the patients
recovered after antimicrobial therapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Primary cultures of blood processed by centrifugation after 
blood-cell lysis yielded adherent, white, iridescent, morphologically
heterogeneous colonies in 5 to 15 days. Subcultures grew in four days on
chocolate, charcoal-yeast extract, or blood agar. The organisms stained weakly
with safranin and were not acid-fast. Fluorescent-antibody tests for legionella
and francisella were negative. Biochemical reactivity was minimal and difficult
to ascertain. Agar-dilution testing revealed in vitro susceptibility to most
antimicrobial agents tested. The cellular fatty acid composition of the isolates 
was similar, resembling that of Rochalimaea quintana or brucella species, but not
Helicobacter pylori or species of campylobacter or legionella. As resolved by gel
electrophoresis, cell-membrane preparations of all isolates contained similar
proteins, with patterns that differed from that of R. quintana. Patterns of
digestion of DNA from all isolates by EcoRV restriction endonuclease were
virtually identical and also differed from that of R. quintana. On
immunodiffusion, serum from one convalescent patient produced a line of identity 
with sonicates of all five isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: This pathogen may have been unidentified until now because of its
slow growth, broad susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, and possible
requirement of blood-cell lysis for recovery in culture. It should be sought as a
cause of unexplained fever, especially in persons with defective cell-mediated
immunity.

    N Engl J Med. 1991 May 23;324(21):1514.
    N Engl J Med. 1990 Dec 6;323(23):1625-7.

BACKGROUND: Bacillary angiomatosis is an infectious disease causing proliferation
of small blood vessels in the skin and visceral organs of patients with human
immunodeficiency virus infection and other immunocompromised hosts. The agent is 
often visualized in tissue sections of lesions with Warthin-Starry staining, but 
the bacillus has not been successfully cultured or identified. This bacillus may 
also cause cat scratch disease.
METHODS: In attempting to identify this organism, we used the polymerase chain
reaction. We used oligonucleotide primers complementary to the 16S ribosomal RNA 
genes of eubacteria to amplify 16S ribosomal gene fragments directly from tissue 
samples of bacillary angiomatosis. The DNA sequence of these fragments was
determined and analyzed for phylogenetic relatedness to other known organisms.
Normal tissues were studied in parallel.
RESULTS: Tissue from three unrelated patients with bacillary angiomatosis yielded
a unique 16S gene sequence. A sequence obtained from a fourth patient with
bacillary angiomatosis differed from the sequence found in the other three
patients at only 4 of 241 base positions. No related 16S gene fragment was
detected in the normal tissues. These 16S sequences associated with bacillary
angiomatosis belong to a previously uncharacterized microorganism, most closely
related to Rochalimaea quintana.
CONCLUSIONS: The cause of bacillary angiomatosis is a previously uncharacterized 
rickettsia-like organism, closely related to R. quintana. This method for the
identification of an uncultured pathogen may be applicable to other infectious
diseases of unknown cause.

Swallowing dysfunction in nephropathic cystinosis.

(1)Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, 
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.

BACKGROUND: Nephropathic cystinosis causes renal failure in most patients at
approximately 10 years of age. This can be prevented or retarded by
cystine-depleting therapy with oral cysteamine. Many patients who do not receive 
adequate cysteamine therapy undergo renal transplantation, but the accumulation
of cystine continues in other organs, resulting in various clinical
abnormalities. We report age-related swallowing dysfunction in patients with
nephropathic cystinosis.
METHODS: We studied 43 patients with cystinosis (24 who had received a renal
transplant and 19 who had not), 3 to 31 years of age. Oral motor function was
assessed by a cranial-nerve oral sensorimotor examination, and an oral motor
index was calculated for each patient. The oral phase of swallowing was assessed 
by ultrasonography, and the pharyngeal and esophageal phases were evaluated by
videofluoroscopy.
RESULTS: Approximately half the patients were slow eaters. Oral motor
dysfunction, reflected by a higher oral motor index, increased with age. Speech, 
oral structure and anatomy, and tongue and lip strength were particularly
affected. Seven of nine patients 21 to 31 years old had abnormalities in all
three phases of swallowing; the deficits were variable in younger patients. In 28
patients with cystinosis, the mean (+/- SD) duration of oropharyngeal swallowing 
for a dry swallow (3.06 +/- 1.06 seconds) was longer than in 14 normal subjects
(1.89 +/- 0.57 seconds; P less than 0.001). This prolongation reflected
impairment of the initiation phase of swallowing.
CONCLUSIONS: Swallowing dysfunction is a late complication of nephropathic
cystinosis, probably related to muscular dysfunction. Changes in the consistency 
of foods, swallowing exercises, and long-term cysteamine therapy should be
considered for patients with cystinosis who have difficulty in swallowing.

An outbreak of toxic encephalopathy caused by eating mussels contaminated with
domoic acid.

In Canada in late 1987 there was an outbreak of an acute illness characterized by
gastrointestinal symptoms and unusual neurologic abnormalities among persons who 
had eaten cultivated mussels. Health departments in Canada solicited reports of
this newly recognized illness. A case was defined as the occurrence of
gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours or of neurologic symptoms within 48
hours of the ingestion of mussels. From the more than 250 reports received, 107
patients met the case definition. The most common symptoms were vomiting (in 76
percent of the patients), abdominal cramps (50 percent), diarrhea (42 percent),
headache, often described as incapacitating (43 percent), and loss of short-term 
memory (25 percent). Nineteen patients were hospitalized, of whom 12 required
intensive care because of seizures, coma, profuse respiratory secretions, or
unstable blood pressure. Male sex and increasing age were associated
independently with the risks of hospitalization and memory loss. Three patients
died. Mussels associated with this illness were traced to cultivation beds in
three river estuaries on the eastern coast of Prince Edward Island. Domoic acid, 
which can act as an excitatory neurotransmitter, was identified in mussels left
uneaten by the patients and in mussels sampled from these estuaries. The source
of the domoic acid appears to have been a form of marine vegetation, Nitzschia
pungens, also identified in these waters in late 1987. The contaminated mussels
from Prince Edward Island were removed from the market, and no new cases have
occurred since December 1987. We conclude that the cause of this outbreak of a
novel and severe intoxication was the ingestion of mussels contaminated by domoic
acid, a potent excitatory neurotransmitter.

Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by a short stature, brachydactyly, subcutaneous ossifications, and 
reduced expression or function of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein 
(Gs alpha) of adenylate cyclase, which is necessary for the action of parathyroid
and other hormones that use cyclic AMP as an intracellular second messenger. We
identified a unique Gs alpha protein in erythrocytes from two related patients
with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy and reduced Gs alpha bioactivity. The
Gs alpha variant was recognized by a carboxyl terminal-specific Gs alpha
antiserum but not by polyclonal antiserums specific for the amino terminus of Gs 
alpha. To investigate the molecular basis for this structurally abnormal Gs alpha
protein, we studied the Gs alpha gene by restriction-endonuclease analysis. DNA
from the two patients had an abnormal restriction-fragment pattern when digested 
with Ncol, which was consistent with loss of an Ncol restriction site in exon 1
of one Gs alpha allele. Amplification of a 260-base-pair region that includes
exon 1 of the Gs alpha gene and direct sequencing of the amplified DNA revealed
an A-to-G transition at position +1 in one Gs alpha allele from each of the two
patients. This mutation converts the initiator ATG (methionine) codon to GTG
(valine), blocking initiation of translation at the normal site. Translation of
the abnormal Gs alpha messenger RNA would result in the synthesis of a truncated 
Gs alpha molecule lacking the amino terminus. We conclude that in at least some
patients with Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, the disease is caused by a
single-base substitution in the Gs alpha gene and is thus due to an inherited
mutation in a human G protein.

We report on a series of three patients with an unusual syndrome of eosinophilia 
and myalgia associated with the oral ingestion of tryptophan that was recognized 
in New Mexico in October 1989. All three patients, who were women 37 to 44 years 
of age, had severe muscle pain, muscle weakness, mouth ulcers, and striking
eosinophilia (more than 8 X 10(9) cells per liter). Other manifestations included
fever, abdominal pain, dyspnea, skin rash, and elevated serum concentrations of
aminotransferase and aldolase. The women had been taking tryptophan in doses of
1.2 to 2.4 g a day for three weeks to 2 1/2 years. The discontinuation of
tryptophan and the initiation of glucocorticoid treatment resulted in
improvement, but all three women were still symptomatic three to five months
later. Tests for trichinosis and other parasites and for allergic and
connective-tissues disorders were negative, and serum immunoglobulin
concentrations and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were normal. A muscle biopsy
in one patient and biopsies of the vagina, liver, and other abdominal organs in
another revealed eosinophilic infiltration, as well as the extracellular
deposition of eosinophil-granule major basic protein. All three patients had
elevated serum and urinary levels of this protein and eosinophil-derived
neurotoxin, indicative of eosinophil degranulation. The syndrome of eosinophilia 
and myalgia in association with the ingestion of tryptophan that was seen in
these three patients is a newly recognized adverse effect of tryptophan
ingestion. Our identification of this association in these patients led to the
discovery of an epidemic of what is now called the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.

An association between the ingestion tryptophan and a syndrome characterized by
scleroderma-like skin abnormalities, fasciitis, and eosinophilia has recently
been recognized in the United States. We report the clinical and
histopathological findings in nine patients and the results of biochemical
analyses of tryptophan metabolism in seven patients with this syndrome. Edema of 
the extremities, frequently accompanied by pruritus, paresthesia, and myalgia,
developed in the nine patients (six women and three men; age range, 30 to 66
years) 1 to 18 months after the start of therapy with tryptophan (1.5 to 3.0 g
daily) for insomnia, depression, or obesity. Five patients were taking drugs
(benzodiazepines) known to inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, and
one had adrenal insufficiency. All had blood eosinophilia in the acute phase of
their illness (mean eosinophil count [+/- SD], 3.62 +/- 2.87 X 10(9) cells per
liter). All had histopathological changes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue
typical of scleroderma, and seven patients had eosinophils. The fascia was
inflamed and fibrotic, and adjacent skeletal muscle often showed perifascicular
inflammation. Tryptophan was discontinued in all patients, and eight received
prednisone. The cutaneous symptoms improved, but only two patients had complete
resolution of their illness. The patients had plasma levels of tryptophan before 
and after an oral dose of tryptophan that were similar to those in normal
subjects. Plasma levels of L-kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which are
metabolites of tryptophan, were significantly higher in four patients with active
disease than in three patients studied after eosinophilia had resolved or in five
normal subjects (P less than 0.001)--findings consistent with the activation of
the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase. This illness resembles eosinophilic
fasciitis and probably represents one aspect of the recently reported
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The development of the syndrome may result from a 
confluence of several factors, including the ingestion of tryptophan, exposure to
agents that activate indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, and possibly, impaired function
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

The recognition of renal cysts in two patients with chronic hypokalemia and the
renal effects of hypokalemia in certain species of animals prompted this study of
the possible association of hypokalemia and renal cysts in patients with primary 
aldosteronism or primary renal potassium wasting. Using CT scans, we studied 55
patients with primary aldosteronism, of whom 24 had cysts (44 percent). The cysts
were more frequent in patients with adrenal tumors than in those with idiopathic 
adrenal hyperplasia. Sixteen of the 26 patients with tumors (62 percent) had
renal cysts, which were often multiple and located in the medulla. Lower plasma
potassium levels and higher serum aldosterone levels, urinary aldosterone
excretion, and plasma renin activity were correlated with the extent of the
cystic disease. Sequential observations indicated that prolonged hypokalemia can 
be accompanied by the development of renal scarring and that the size and number 
of cysts can decrease markedly in some patients after the removal of an adrenal
adenoma. The association of hypokalemia, aldosteronism, and renal cysts was also 
supported by the finding of multiple medullary cysts in two patients with primary
renal potassium wasting. We conclude that chronic hypokalemia is accompanied by
enhanced renal cytogenesis and may lead to interstitial scarring and renal
insufficiency. Renal cysts are thus dynamic structures whose growth can be
influenced by hormonal or pharmacologic interventions.

PIP: Human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) epidemiology in Belgium shows that 66%
of all acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients were infected heterosexually. 
Since 1985, all HIV-seropositive patients in Brussels and Antwerp who have been
heterosexually infected have been offered participation in a partner notification
program; this article reports the case study of 1 HIV infected male and his 19
identified previous women sexual partners. This report describes the patient's
background and the type and frequency of sexual intercourse he had with each
partner. The characteristics of each of the sexual partners were also described. 
An important consideration of this case was that 11 of the tested partners (56%) 
were HIV seropositive. Several factors were discussed concerning the cause of
this high rate of transmission (e.g. high disseminator patient, highly virulent
HIV strain, and presence of genital herpes). This study emphasizes the fact that 
middle class women with low risk sexual practices were infected with AIDS from as
little as 1 sexual encounter with this infected individual. To stop a false sense
of security among people with few sexual partners, it was advised that a program 
of partner notification targeted to heterosexuals be implemented along with other
public health policies.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with serious or fatal
lymphoproliferative disease in immunocompromised patients. EBV nuclear protein 2 
and latent membrane protein are characteristically expressed in B lymphocytes
proliferating in vitro in response to growth transformation by EBV. These two
proteins are thought to be effectors of lymphocyte growth since they increase the
expression of B-lymphocyte activation (CD23) and cell-adhesion (LFA 3 and ICAM 1)
molecules in vitro. Using monoclonal antibody-immune microscopy, we have
demonstrated that these two EBV proteins and their associated B-lymphocyte
activation or adhesion molecules are expressed in the infiltrating B lymphocytes 
in immunocompromised patients with EBV lymphoproliferative disease. These
monoclonal antibodies should be useful in the early diagnosis of EBV
lymphoproliferative disease and in distinguishing it from other B-lymphocyte
cancers associated with EBV, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. The finding of EBV
nuclear protein 2 and latent membrane protein and their associated activation or 
adhesion molecules provides a further pathophysiologic link between EBV and the
proliferation of B lymphocytes in immunocompromised patients.

Inhibin is a peptide hormone normally produced by ovarian granulosa cells. It
reaches a peak of 772 +/- 38 U per liter in the follicular phase of the menstrual
cycle and is undetectable in the serum of menopausal women. To determine whether 
measurements of serum inhibin levels would provide a biochemical marker of the
presence or progression of ovarian granulosa-cell tumors and their metastases, we
measured the serum immunoreactive inhibin concentrations in six women with such
tumors. Three women had been treated by hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy. In the two women with residual or recurrent disease, the
serum inhibin levels were abnormally elevated 5 and 20 months before the clinical
manifestations of recurrence became evident. The maximal concentrations
approached 3000 U per liter. The serum inhibin level remained undetectable in one
patient who was disease-free for 11 years. Serum inhibin concentrations were also
elevated in three women with amenorrhea and infertility that resulted from small 
granulosa-cell tumors. After the removal of the tumors, the serum inhibin levels 
in these women became normal, and fertility returned. There was a significant
negative correlation between the serum concentrations of inhibin and
follicle-stimulating hormone, in a manner consistent with the autonomous
production of inhibin by granulosa-cell tumors. We conclude that granulosa-cell
tumors produce inhibin. Since serum inhibin levels reflect the size of the tumor,
measurements of inhibin can be used as a marker for primary as well as recurrent 
disease.

In the spring and summer of 1988, two separate outbreaks of an illness with a
rash resembling erythema infectiosum occurred among members of the nursing staff 
of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The sources were two adolescent
patients with sickle cell disease and aplastic crisis who had unsuspected
parvovirus infection. Tests for IgM and IgG antibodies to parvovirus B19 were
positive in both patients, and electron microscopical examination showed
parvovirus-like particles in the early serum samples. Of 40 health care workers
exposed to infected patients, 12 (30 percent) were infected, 2 (5 percent) were
possibly infected, 8 (20 percent) had evidence of a past infection with B19, and 
18 (45 percent) remained seronegative. Attack rates among the susceptible
contacts were 36 percent in the first outbreak and at least 38 percent in the
second. Clinical symptoms began a mean of 12.6 days after exposure and included
malaise, rash, and joint pain. We conclude that hospital workers are at risk of
contracting nosocomial erythema infectiosum from patients with
parvovirus-associated aplastic crisis. We recommend that all patients with
hereditary hemolytic anemias who are admitted with a febrile illness be evaluated
for aplasia and promptly placed in respiratory and contact isolation if aplastic 
crisis is suspected.

Congenital agranulocytosis is a disorder characterized by severe neutropenia and 
a profound deficiency of identifiable neutrophil progenitors in bone marrow. In
an attempt to stimulate neutrophil production and thereby reduce the morbidity
and mortality associated with this disease, we administered recombinant human
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in doses of 3 to 60 micrograms
per kilogram of body weight per day to five patients with congenital
agranulocytosis. In all five patients, an increase in the number of neutrophils
was noted eight to nine days after the initiation of the effective dosage (the
dose at which the neutrophil count reached 1000 cells per microliter or more and 
the bone marrow showed granulocyte maturation beyond the myelocyte stage). The
absolute neutrophil counts rose from less than 100 to between 1300 and 9500 cells
per microliter. Marrow aspirates obtained after 14 days at the effective dosage
showed maturation to the mature neutrophil stage. The side effects that were
observed were medullary pain, splenomegaly, and an elevation of levels of
leukocyte alkaline phosphatase. All five patients have had sustained neutrophil
counts of 1000 cells per microliter or more for 9 to 13 months while receiving
subcutaneous maintenance therapy. Preexisting chronic infections have resolved
clinically, and the number of new infectious episodes and the requirement for
intravenous antibiotics have decreased. We conclude that treatment with rhG-CSF
can lead to a large increase in the numbers of functional neutrophils in patients
with congenital agranulocytosis.

We determined the rates of seroconversion to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
(HIV-1) and human T-cell leukemia virus Type I (HTLV-I) in a cohort of patients
receiving transfusions of blood components screened for antibody to HIV-1.
Preoperative and postoperative serum samples were collected from 4163 adults
undergoing cardiac surgery who received 36,282 transfusions of blood components. 
The postoperative samples from all patients were tested for serologic evidence of
HIV-1 infection, and those that were positive were compared with the
corresponding preoperative samples. One case of HIV-1 transmission by transfusion
of screened blood components was identified; two preexisting HIV-1 infections
were found. Samples from 2749 patients were tested similarly for serologic
evidence of HTLV-I infection; these patients received 20,963 units of blood
components. Five new cases and two preexisting cases of HTLV-I infection were
detected. The observed risk of HIV-1 transmission by transfusion was 0.003
percent per unit; the risk of HTLV-I transmission was 0.024 percent per unit. We 
conclude that there is a very small risk of HTLV-I infection from transfused
blood products that have been screened for antibodies to HIV-1, but that it is
nearly 10-fold higher than the risk of HIV-1 infection.

We studied a nine-year-old boy with severe, recurrent infections. The patient was
exposed in utero to azathioprine and prednisone. He had autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, bronchiectasis, and Hodgkin's disease. The patient's circulating
lymphocytes were normal in number and phenotype, but stimulation of the T-cell
receptor by antigens, mitogens, and monoclonal antibodies failed to induce
interleukin-2-receptor expression, interleukin-2 synthesis, or lymphocyte
proliferation. The early biochemical events necessary to initiate lymphocyte
activation--accumulation of the second messenger diacylglycerol, activation of
the enzyme protein kinase C, and elevation of the free intracellular calcium
concentration--failed to occur in this patient's lymphocytes. The defect in the
lymphocyte could be corrected in vitro by two agents that bypass the
receptor-mediated signal mechanism (the diacylglycerol analogue phorbol and the
calcium ionophore ionomycin). Further studies localized the defect in signal
transduction to the interaction between cell-surface receptors and the guanine
nucleotide-binding protein. We conclude that this patient's immunodeficiency was 
caused by a defective coupling of surface receptors to signal-transducing
proteins in his T lymphocytes, resulting in failure of lymphocyte activation.

In 1984 we started a two-year program in Worcester (Mass.) and Boston to provide 
additional radiologic data for the medical investigation of suspected fatal
infant abuse. During that period the investigation of 12 cases of unexplained
infant death included the review of complete radiographic skeletal surveys by a
pediatric radiologist. Autopsies were supplemented with resection, high-detail
radiography, and histologic study of all non-cranial sites of suspected osseous
injury. Thirty-four bony injuries were noted, including 12 acute and 16 healing
fractures of the long-bone metaphyses and posterior-rib arcs in patterns
indicative of infant abuse. The investigations determined that there were eight
cases of abuse, two accidental deaths, and two natural deaths (sudden infant
death syndrome). At this writing, the radiologic and osseous histologic studies
appear to have influenced the determination of the manner of death in six of the 
eight cases of abuse and the criminal prosecution in four of the five
convictions. These findings suggest that a thorough postmortem radiologic
evaluation followed by selected histologic studies can have an impact on the
investigation and prosecution of cases of fatal infant abuse.

A deficiency of the protein dystrophin is known to be the cause of Duchenne's
muscular dystrophy. To examine the expression of dystrophin in symptomatic female
carriers of this X-linked recessive disorder, we performed immunohistochemical
studies on muscle-biopsy specimens from three such carriers, using an antiserum
raised against a synthetic peptide fragment of dystrophin. In all three carriers,
most individual muscle fibers reacted either strongly or not at all to the
antiserum for dystrophin; only 2 to 8 percent of fibers showed partial
immunostaining. This mosaic staining pattern was present on both cross-sectional 
and longitudinal muscle specimens. Although the mosaic pattern was seen in all
fiber types, more than 80 percent of type 2B and 2C fibers from two of the
carriers did not react with the antiserum. Similar studies in nine normal
subjects showed consistently strong staining of all muscle fibers. No muscle
fibers from 31 patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy reacted with the
antiserum. We conclude that symptomatic carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy
can be identified by a distinct mosaic pattern in the immunohistochemical
staining of the surface membrane of skeletal-muscle specimens. This finding may
have practical implications for genetic counseling, although it remains to be
shown whether the same staining pattern will be found in muscle specimens from
asymptomatic carriers of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.

Auxiliary partial liver transplantation for end-stage chronic liver disease.

Auxiliary heterotopic liver transplantation is theoretically attractive because
it leaves the recipient's liver in place. The surgical trauma of hepatectomy is
avoided, and failure of the graft does not necessarily lead to the death of the
patient or a second, emergency transplantation. Another advantage is that
matching the body sizes of the donor and the recipient is not mandatory, which
increases the number of possible donors. However, previous clinical results of
auxiliary liver transplantation have been poor. We performed auxiliary partial
liver transplantation in six consecutive patients with end-stage chronic liver
disease who were not accepted for orthotopic liver transplantation because they
had massive ascites, deficient clotting function, cachexia, or poor pulmonary
reserve. The donor liver was transplanted to the right subhepatic region after
removal of segments II and III, and it was provided with portal and arterial
blood. There were no major changes in hemodynamic measurements during surgery.
The mean hospital stay after transplantation was 22.7 days (range, 14 to 29).
After a mean follow-up period of 14 months (range, 5 to 23), all patients were
alive, with good graft function as demonstrated by scintigraphy, Doppler
ultrasonography, and synthesis of clotting factors. From these observations we
conclude that auxiliary partial liver transplantation is an attractive
alternative to orthotopic liver transplantation in high-risk patients. Its role
in other patients who need liver transplants remains to be defined.

Synthesis and secretion of insulin-like growth factor II by a leiomyosarcoma with
associated hypoglycemia.

We describe a case of recurrent hypoglycemia apparently caused by secretion of
insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) by a leiomyosarcoma. A 67-year-old woman
presented with recurrent severe hypoglycemia and a large mass in the thorax.
During hypoglycemia, plasma cortisol was elevated, but insulin and growth hormone
levels were low. After resection of a large leiomyosarcoma, the hypoglycemia
resolved. After an eight-year remission, both the tumor and symptomatic
hypoglycemia recurred. During a second operation a second large tumor was
removed, with relief of the patient's hypoglycemia. The tumor contained high
concentrations of IGF-II mRNA and 2100 ng of IGF-II immunoreactive peptide per
gram. Filtration through a BioGel P-60 gel column established that 77 percent of 
the IGF-II was present as a larger molecule, demonstrating incomplete processing 
of the pro-IGF-II peptides. A similar fraction of high-molecular-weight IGF-II
was present in the serum, indicating that the tumor was the chief source of
IGF-II. The high-molecular-weight IGF-II found in both the tumor and serum was
fully reactive with the IGF-II receptor. Radioimmunoassay showed that the
concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in tumor and serum were
low, suggesting feedback inhibition of growth hormone secretion by IGF-II. Eight 
months after reoperation, plasma concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II were normal, 
and high-molecular-weight IGF-II was virtually undetectable. We conclude that the
most likely cause of this patient's recurrent hypoglycemia was IGF-II produced by
the leiomyosarcoma.

Seventeen cases of otitis media caused by Mycobacterium chelonae were detected
among patients seen at a single ear-nose-and-throat (ENT) office (Office A) in
Louisiana between May 5 and September 15, 1987. All the patients had a
tympanotomy tube or tubes in place or had one or more tympanic-membrane
perforations, with chronic otorrhea that was unresponsive to standard therapy
with antimicrobial agents. Middle-ear exploration in six patients revealed
abundant granulation tissue; multiple granulomas and acid-fast bacilli were
demonstrated on a section of tissue from one patient with a nonhealing
mastoidectomy incision. Thirteen of the 14 ear isolates obtained from patients
seen in Office A had the same unusual pattern of high-level resistance to
aminoglycosides. M. chelonae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria were recovered
from several sources of water in Office A, as well as in another ENT office
(Office B) in a neighboring city that was visited by the index patient. Only one 
additional case was detected in Office B during the same period. Otologic
instruments in Office A were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with tap water and a
liquid detergent; the contents of the bath were changed only once weekly.
Instruments in Office B were placed in boiling water between patient
examinations. This outbreak establishes M. chelonae as an agent of otitis media
and underscores the need for high-level disinfection or sterilization of ENT
instruments between examinations to prevent the transmission of this organism to 
patients in the office setting.

    N Engl J Med. 1989 Jul 27;321(4):263-4.

Among 873 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for various
reasons over a two-year period, four had a loss of Kerckring's folds in the
descending duodenum. Endoscopic duodenal biopsy in all four patients revealed
subtotal villous atrophy due to celiac disease. We undertook a prospective study 
to evaluate the extent to which this finding predicted celiac disease in 65
consecutive patients referred for intestinal biopsy. Duodenal folds were absent
or markedly decreased in 15 of 17 patients with subtotal villous atrophy and in 8
of 48 patients with partial villous atrophy or normal duodenal mucosa, giving a
sensitivity of 88 percent and a specificity of 83 percent for this endoscopic
finding with respect to celiac disease. We recommend that all patients undergoing
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy be examined for the loss or reduction of
duodenal folds and, should this be found, that the examination include duodenal
biopsy. The value of this procedure as an aid in the diagnosis of celiac disease 
should be particularly great in patients with minimal, transient, or unrelated
symptoms.

In Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, functional impairment of smooth muscle in the
gastrointestinal tract can cause acute gastric dilatation and intestinal
pseudo-obstruction that may be fatal. We describe a patient with this syndrome
who at autopsy had smooth-muscle degeneration of the stomach. To provide
objective evidence of functional smooth-muscle impairment in Duchenne's
dystrophy, we performed gastric-emptying studies in 11 patients and 11 normal
controls, using technetium-99m radionuclide scintigraphy in a test meal of
oatmeal. The patients with Duchenne's dystrophy had delayed gastric-emptying
times (118.18 +/- 32.21 minutes [mean +/- SEM]) as compared with controls (42.5
+/- 3.4 minutes, P less than 0.01). The cause of the pathological and functional 
abnormalities we describe in smooth muscle is unknown but may be a deficiency of 
dystrophin, the recently identified gene product of the Duchenne's muscular
dystrophy locus.

A deficiency of the protein dystrophin has recently been shown to be the probable
cause of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. We sought to determine the relation
between the clinical phenotype and the status of dystrophin in muscle-biopsy
specimens from 103 patients with various neuromuscular disorders. We found very
low levels (less than 3 percent of normal levels) or no dystrophin in the severe 
Duchenne phenotype (35 of 38 patients), low concentrations of dystrophin in the
intermediate (outlier) phenotype (4 of 7), and dystrophin of abnormal molecular
weight in the mild Becker phenotype (12 of 18). Normal levels of dystrophin of
normal molecular weight were found in nearly all the patients (38 of 40) with 20 
other neuromuscular disorders we studied. These data show the clinical
consequences of both quantitative alterations (in Duchenne's and intermediate
dystrophy) in a single protein. The biochemical assay for dystrophin should prove
helpful in delineating myopathies that overlap clinically with Duchenne's and
Becker's dystrophies, and it shows promise as an accurate diagnostic tool.

Bronx Hospital.

In the spring and summer of 1987, four persons acquired Rocky Mountain spotted
fever within New York City, an area in which the disease had not previously been 
known to be endemic. Three of the four patients were residents of the Soundview
area of the Bronx. All diagnoses were confirmed by indirect fluorescent-antibody 
tests. Environmental investigation revealed that the tick vector for Rickettsia
rickettsii, Dermacentor variabilis, was present in a local park. Of the 66
specimens of D. variabilis collected, 5 (8 percent) were positive for rickettsiae
from the spotted fever group. Of an additional 96 specimens of D. variabilis, 5
(5 percent) were found positive for rickettsiae by a more specific monoclonal
antibody assay. Eight additional New York City parks in all five boroughs were
searched for ticks. D. variabilis was found in only one other park; of the 147
ticks collected there, none were positive for rickettsiae. These findings
emphasize the focal nature of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the need to
consider that disease in the differential diagnosis of any obscure acute febrile 
illness, even in the absence of a history of travel to known endemic areas.

Stiff-man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system consisting of
progressive, fluctuating muscle rigidity with painful spasms. It is occasionally 
associated with endocrine disorders, including insulin-dependent diabetes, and
with epilepsy. We investigated the possible existence of autoimmunity against the
nervous system in a patient with stiff-man syndrome associated with epilepsy and 
Type I diabetes mellitus. Levels of IgG, which had an oligoclonal pattern, were
elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid. The serum and the cerebrospinal fluid
produced an identical, intense staining of all gray-matter regions when used to
stain brain sections according to an indirect light-microscopical
immunocytochemical procedure. The staining patterns were identical to those
produced by antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme responsible for
the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid). A band comigrating with glutamic acid 
decarboxylase in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels appeared to be the
only nervous-tissue antigen recognized by cerebrospinal fluid antibodies, and the
predominant antigen recognized by serum antibodies. These findings support the
idea that an impairment of neuronal pathways that operate through
gamma-aminobutyric acid is involved in the pathogenesis of stiff-man syndrome,
and they raise the possibility of an autoimmune pathogenesis.

Fatal T-cell lymphomas developed in three patients with a chronic illness
manifested by fever, pneumonia, dysgammaglobulinemia, hematologic abnormalities, 
and extraordinarily high titers of antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
capsid antigen (greater than 10,000) and early antigen (greater than 640) but low
titers to the EBV nuclear antigen (less than or equal to 40). To understand the
pathogenesis of these tumors better, we determined the immunophenotype of the
tumor cells and analyzed tumor-cell DNA for EBV genomes and for lymphoid-cell
gene rearrangements. More than 80 percent of the cells in tumors had an activated
helper T-cell phenotype (T4, T11, la positive). The EBV genome was found by in
situ hybridization in tumor tissue from each patient. Southern blot assay of DNA 
digests from one patient showed the same pattern as that of the EBV-infected
marmoset line, B95-8. DNA digests from two patients showed a monoclonal
proliferation of T cells determined on the basis of uniform T-cell-receptor gene 
rearrangements and a single band for the joined termini of the EBV genome. We
conclude that EBV may infect T cells and contribute to lymphomas in selected
patients with severe EBV infections.

Since early 1985, blood donations in the United States have been screened for
antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To identify instances of HIV
transmission by antibody-negative donations, we investigated 13 persons
seropositive for HIV who had received blood from 7 donors who were screened as
negative for HIV antibody at the time of donation. Twelve of the 13 recipients
had no identifiable risk factors for HIV infection other than the transfusions
they had received. On evaluation 8 to 20 months after transfusion, HIV-related
illnesses had developed in three recipients, and the acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome had developed in one. All seven donors were found to be infected with
HIV. On interview, six reported a risk factor for HIV infection, and five had
engaged in high-risk activities or had had an illness suggestive of acute
retroviral syndrome within the four months preceding their HIV-seronegative
donation. Thus, these donors had apparently been infected only recently, and so
were negative at the time of blood donation according to available antibody
tests. We conclude that there is a small but identifiable risk of HIV infection
for recipients of screened blood. To minimize this risk, the reasons for deferral
of donation need to be communicated more effectively to blood donors who are at
high risk of HIV infection, and new assays that detect HIV infection earlier
should be evaluated for their effectiveness in screening donated blood.

Artificial feeding--solid ground, not a slippery slope.

Steinbrook R(1), Lo B.

Author information: 
(1)Division of General Internal Medicine, University of California, San
Francisco.

Decisions about artificial feeding arouse more controversy than those involving
any other life-sustaining treatment. Because food and water are generally
considered basic elements of humane care, representing love and concern for the
helpless, it is often thought that they must always be provided. In a landmark
decision, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled that a feeding tube
could be removed from a patient in a persistent vegetative state if this was
consistent with his previously expressed wishes. The case of Paul E. Brophy, Sr.,
is part of an emerging medical and legal consensus on the withholding of
artificial feeding from adult patients. The view is growing that tube and
intravenous feeding should be likened to other medical interventions and not to
the routine provision of nursing care or comfort. Competent patients have the
right to refuse such feeding. Feeding can also be stopped incompetent patients
who have earlier stated such a wish.

Renal disease in type I glycogen storage disease.

(1)Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.

Although kidney enlargement occurs in Type I glycogen storage disease, renal
disease has not been considered a major problem. Death from renal failure in
three patients known to us prompted a study of renal function in this disorder.
Of the 38 patients with Type I glycogen storage disease under our care, the 18
children under 10 years old had normal renal function. Fourteen of the 20 older
patients (13 to 47 years) had disturbed renal function, manifested by persistent 
proteinuria; many also had hypertension, hematuria, or altered creatinine
clearance. Progressive renal insufficiency developed in 6 of these 14 patients,
leading to three deaths from renal failure. At the onset of proteinuria,
creatinine clearance was increased in seven patients (3.05 +/- 0.68 ml per second
per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area; range, 2.47 to 4.13 [normal range, 1.33 to 2.33
ml per second per 1.73 m2]). Renal biopsies were performed in three patients
after an average of 10 years of proteinuria. All three biopsies demonstrated
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in various stages of progression. Our data
suggest that chronic renal disease is a frequent and potentially serious
complication of Type I glycogen storage disease. In addition to treating
hypoglycemia vigorously, physicians should monitor renal function carefully in
patients with this disorder.

Central nervous system toxicity after liver transplantation. The role of
cyclosporine and cholesterol.

de Groen PC, Aksamit AJ, Rakela J, Forbes GS, Krom RA.

We describe severe central nervous system (CNS) toxicity, manifested by
confusion, cortical blindness, quadriplegia, seizures, and coma, associated with 
cyclosporine treatment in three patients undergoing liver transplantation. CT and
magnetic resonance studies disclosed a severe, diffuse disorder of the white
matter. All side effects and radiographic findings were reversed with
discontinuation or a reduction in the dose of cyclosporine. We also observed an
inverse association between CNS side effects and total serum cholesterol levels
after transplantation. A retrospective analysis of 54 liver transplantations
performed in 48 patients revealed that 13 patients had symptoms of CNS toxicity
associated with the use of cyclosporine. These patients' total serum cholesterol 
levels in the first week after transplantation were reduced as compared with
those in patients without symptoms (mean +/- SE, 94 +/- 4 mg per deciliter vs.
132 +/- 6, or 2.44 +/- 0.10 mmol per liter vs. 3.43 +/- 0.16). We conclude that
cyclosporine therapy for immunosuppression in liver transplantation may cause a
syndrome of encephalopathy, seizures, and white-matter changes and that this is
most likely to occur in patients with low total serum cholesterol levels after
transplantation.

Production of lymphotoxin, a bone-resorbing cytokine, by cultured human myeloma
cells.

Garrett IR, Durie BG, Nedwin GE, Gillespie A, Bringman T, Sabatini M, Bertolini
DR, Mundy GR.

Myeloma cells destroy bone by producing an osteoclast-stimulating factor that has
chemical and biological characteristics similar to the bone-resorbing activity
present in the supernatants of activated leukocyte cultures. Recently, a number
of bone-resorbing leukocyte cytokines have been identified, including
interleukin-1, lymphotoxin, and tumor necrosis factor. We have examined the
products of human myeloma cells for the presence of these bone-resorbing
cytokines. In a tumor cell line derived from a patient who had myeloma with
osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia, we found that the myeloma cells
induced bone-resorbing activity and cytotoxic activity in vitro. Most of the
bone-resorbing activity and all cytotoxic activity were suppressed by
neutralizing antibodies to lymphotoxin. The myeloma cells expressed both
lymphotoxin and tumor necrosis factor mRNA, but no tumor necrosis factor could be
detected in the cell-culture medium. Interleukin-1 mRNA was not detected in the
myeloma cells, and biologic activity of interleukin-1 was not measurable in the
medium harvested from the cultured cells. The bone-resorbing activity induced by 
recombinant tumor necrosis factor and recombinant interleukin-1 was not affected 
by treatment with the lymphotoxin antibodies. When lymphotoxin was infused
subcutaneously into normal mice (10 micrograms per day for three days), their
plasma calcium levels increased. We also evaluated four established cell lines
derived from three other patients with myeloma, and found a similar pattern of
lymphotoxin expression in each. It appears that production of the bone-resorbing 
cytokine lymphotoxin is related to osteoclastic bone destruction and
hypercalcemia in patients with myeloma.

Association between lupus psychosis and anti-ribosomal P protein antibodies.

Bonfa E, Golombek SJ, Kaufman LD, Skelly S, Weissbach H, Brot N, Elkon KB.

In 18 of 20 patients with psychosis secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), autoantibodies to ribosomal P proteins were detected by immunoblotting and
measured with a new radioimmunoassay using a synthetic peptide as antigen. The
frequency of anti-P was not increased in patients with other central nervous
system manifestations of SLE (3 of 20, by radioimmunoassay), in patients with
transient behavioral abnormalities due to SLE (none of 8), in patients with
psychosis who did not have SLE (none of 13), or in normal controls (none of 20). 
In four of five paired serum samples, anti-P-peptide antibody levels increased
5-fold to 30-fold during the active phase of lupus psychosis. Longitudinal
studies of anti-P activity in two patients with psychosis revealed that anti-P
levels increased before and during the active phases of psychosis but not during 
sepsis or other exacerbations of SLE, and that the elevations were selective for 
anti-P antibodies, as opposed to anti-DNA antibodies. Longitudinal studies of
anti-P activity in two patients with anti-P but without psychosis showed less
than threefold changes in anti-P levels despite exacerbations of disease. We
conclude that anti-P is associated with lupus psychosis and that synthetic
peptide antigens may be useful for the detection and measurement of
autoantibodies to intracellular proteins.

Lead poisoning in automobile radiator mechanics.

Goldman RH, Baker EL, Hannan M, Kamerow DB.

Exposure to lead occurs during automobile radiator repair when soldered joints
are heated, but this relatively common hazard has received little public
recognition. We therefore studied lead exposure among automobile radiator
mechanics in the Boston area. Twenty-seven shops were surveyed, and most were
found to be small and poorly ventilated. Seventy-five workers were interviewed
and tested for blood lead and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels. Fifty-six
of the 75 actually repaired radiators, and they had a mean blood lead level of
37.1 micrograms per deciliter (range, 16 to 73). Thirty-nine percent of these
mechanics had levels higher than 40 micrograms per deciliter; hematologic,
neurologic, and renal effects are known to develop at or above this blood lead
level. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of radiator repair
work stations (an index of exposure) was the variable most significantly
associated with increased blood lead levels. We conclude that excessive exposure 
to lead occurs frequently among radiator repair workers and should be prevented
by improved ventilation, engineering controls, and the use of respirators (if
indicated) while working.

The use of trientine in preventing the effects of interrupting penicillamine
therapy in Wilson's disease.

Scheinberg IH, Jaffe ME, Sternlieb I.

Penicillamine is known to be effective therapy for Wilson's disease. However, the
clinical consequences of the abrupt and permanent withdrawal of penicillamine
have not been investigated. We studied 11 patients who stopped their own
treatment after having been treated successfully with penicillamine (1 to 2 g per
day) for periods of 3 to 19 years. Eight died of hepatic decompensation or
fulminant hepatitis after an average survival of only 2.6 years. In another 13
patients, penicillamine was discontinued by the physician because of serious
adverse reactions. In these patients, penicillamine was replaced with trientine
(1 to 1.5 g per day), a newer chelating agent. All but one of these patients (who
was killed accidentally) are alive at this writing, from 2 to 15 years later. Our
observations suggest that discontinuation of penicillamine in patients with
Wilson's disease results in rapid clinical deterioration, which is often fatal.
The replacement of penicillamine with trientine appears to prevent this adverse
clinical course.

Myogenic hyperuricemia. A common pathophysiologic feature of glycogenosis types
III, V, and VII.

Mineo I, Kono N, Hara N, Shimizu T, Yamada Y, Kawachi M, Kiyokawa H, Wang YL,
Tarui S.

To identify the mechanism of hyperuricemia in glycogen storage diseases
(glycogenoses) that affect muscle, we studied the effects of exercise and
prolonged rest on purine metabolism in two patients with glycogenosis type III
(debrancher deficiency), one patient with type V (muscle phosphorylase
deficiency), and one patient with type VII (muscle phosphofructokinase
deficiency). All had hyperuricemia except for one patient with glycogenosis type 
III. Plasma concentrations of ammonia, inosine, and hypoxanthine increased
markedly in all the patients after mild leg exercise on a bicycle ergometer. The 
plasma urate concentrations also increased, but with a delayed response. Urinary 
excretion of inosine, hypoxanthine, and urate increased greatly after exercise,
consistently with the increases in plasma levels. Hypoxanthine and urate
concentrations were extremely high in the plasma and urine of the patient with
glycogenosis type VII. With bed rest, the plasma hypoxanthine level returned to
normal within a few hours, and the plasma urate concentration decreased from 18.6
to 10.6 mg per deciliter (1106 to 630 mumol per liter) within 48 hours.
Similarly, the urinary excretion of these purine metabolites was reduced by bed
rest. These findings indicate that muscular exertion in patients with
glycogenosis types III, V, and VII causes excessive increases in blood ammonia,
inosine, and hypoxanthine due to accelerated degradation of muscle purine
nucleotides. These purine metabolites subsequently serve as substrates for the
synthesis of uric acid, leading to hyperuricemia.

Response of thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas to a long-acting
somatostatin analogue.

Comi RJ, Gesundheit N, Murray L, Gorden P, Weintraub BD.

Thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas are aggressive, invasive tumors that
respond poorly to available surgical and medical treatments. Inappropriate
release of thyrotropin by these tumors can result in hyperthyroidism. We treated 
five patients who had thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas with the
long-acting somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995, which was administered by
subcutaneous injection in doses of 50 to 100 micrograms every 8 to 12 hours.
Serum levels of thyrotropin were dramatically reduced by treatment in four of the
five patients, and levels of another tumor marker, the alpha-subunit of
thyrotropin, were reduced in all five. In two patients with hyperthyroidism due
to production of excess thyrotropin by the tumor, treatment with the somatostatin
analogue resulted in a sustained euthyroid state. One patient who was treated for
more than 16 months had a persistent reduction in serum levels of thyrotropin and
iodothyronines. We conclude that SMS 201-995 is an effective means of controlling
hypersecretion of thyrotropin and the associated hyperthyroidism due to
thyrotropin-secreting pituitary tumors.

Alteration in the natural history of neurosyphilis by concurrent infection with
the human immunodeficiency virus.

Johns DR, Tierney M, Felsenstein D.

Within the past 18 months, we have seen four cases of neurosyphilis at our
institution (two of meningovascular syphilis, one of acute syphilitic meningitis,
and one of asymptomatic neurosyphilis) in young homosexual men with serologic
evidence of exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two of the four
patients had neurosyphilis despite previous adequate therapy for early syphilis
with benzathine penicillin. Meningovascular syphilis developed in one patient
within four months after a primary infection, in a manner consistent with an
accelerated course of syphilitic infection. These findings suggest the
possibility that HIV infection may alter the natural course of syphilis because
of the profound defects in cell-mediated immunity it causes. The possible
potentiating effects of HIV on Treponema pallidum infection suggest the need for 
lumbar puncture in the evaluation of HIV-seropositive patients with syphilis, as 
well as modifications of the currently recommended treatment regimens for
primary, secondary, and latent syphilis and neurosyphilis in this patient
population. Neurosyphilis should probably be added to the growing list of
infectious complications of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and may
be the first such complication to appear.

Colchicine myopathy and neuropathy.

Kuncl RW, Duncan G, Watson D, Alderson K, Rogawski MA, Peper M.

Although colchicine has been used for centuries, its neuromuscular toxicity in
humans is largely unrecognized. In this report we describe a characteristic
syndrome of myopathy and neuropathy and present 12 new cases of the condition.
Colchicine myopathy may occur in patients with gout who take customary doses of
the drug but who have elevated plasma drug levels because of altered renal
function. It usually presents with proximal weakness and always presents with
elevation of serum creatine kinase; both features remit within three to four
weeks after the drug is discontinued. The accompanying axonal polyneuropathy is
mild and resolves slowly. Electromyography of proximal muscles shows a myopathy
that is marked by abnormal spontaneous activity. Because of these features,
colchicine myoneuropathy is usually misdiagnosed initially, either as probable
polymyositis or as uremic neuropathy. The myopathy is vacuolar, marked by
accumulation of lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles unrelated to necrosis or to the
mild denervation in distal muscles. The morphologic changes in muscle suggest
that the pathogenesis involves disruption of a microtubule-dependent cytoskeletal
network that interacts with lysosomes. Correct diagnosis may save patients with
this disorder from inappropriate therapy.

Autoantibody-mediated acquired deficiency of C1 inhibitor.

Alsenz J, Bork K, Loos M.

During the past 25 years, three forms of deficiency of the inhibitor of the first
component of complement (C1 inhibitor) with angioedema have been recognized; two 
forms are hereditary and one is acquired. As compared with hereditary angioedema,
the syndrome of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency is rare, and it is usually
associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. We report another type of acquired 
C1-inhibitor deficiency with angioedema. Two patients with recurrent angioedema
but no associated diseases were found to have IgG1 autoantibodies against C1
inhibitor. The anti-C1-inhibitor antibodies prevented binding of C1 inhibitor to 
activated C1s. Both patients had 60 to 70 percent of normal levels of C1
inhibitor, but it was functionally inactive, with a molecular weight of 96,000
(normal C1 inhibitor, 105,000). In vitro studies of the patients' serum revealed 
degradation of 125I-labeled 105,000-dalton C1 inhibitor into the inactive
96,000-dalton molecule, caused by activated C1s and not found in normal human
serum. We conclude that these cases of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency resulted 
from a blockade of C1-inhibitor function by the anti-C1-inhibitor antibodies and 
from subsequent inactivation of C1 inhibitor by the now uncontrolled enzyme,
activated C1s. As in other forms of C1-inhibitor deficiency, the unopposed
activation of the complement system led to angioedema.

Hirsutism, polycystic ovarian disease, and ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase
deficiency.

Pang SY, Softness B, Sweeney WJ 3rd, New MI.

We studied an 18-year-old woman with progressive hirsutism, secondary amenorrhea,
and polycystic ovarian disease. Excess androstenedione was secreted by the
ovaries, most likely because of a genetic deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid
reductase, the enzyme that converts androstenedione to testosterone. Markedly
elevated basal plasma levels of androstenedione, estrone, and testosterone were
regulated by gonadotropin but not by ACTH. The rate of androstenedione production
in the patient's blood at base line and after administration of dexamethasone was
very high (10.0 to 11.6 mg per day; value in control women with hirsutism, less
than 4.1 mg per day), whereas her blood production of testosterone was 0.64 to
0.7 mg per day, similar to or higher than that in control women with hirsutism.
The fractional blood conversion ratio of androstenedione to testosterone was
normal (5.6 percent). Thus, 88 to 93 percent of the testosterone in the blood was
derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione, and very little
testosterone was secreted by the ovaries. These in vivo biochemical data suggest 
that the patient had a deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid reductase activity
but normal pubertal activity. The patient's two younger sisters with peripubertal
symptoms of androgen excess also had elevated serum levels of androstenedione. We
propose that the increased secretion of androstenedione in the three siblings in 
this family was probably due to a genetic deficiency of ovarian 17-ketosteroid
reductase.

X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy.

Berko BA, Swift M.

To study the inheritance of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, we investigated a 
large kindred in which 11 young male members had definite or possible evidence of
the disorder. The five affected males for whom we had complete clinical data
survived for 5 to 12 months after the onset of symptoms, which occurred early in 
life (ages 15 to 21 years). In six other males, clinical data were incomplete but
suggested possible cardiomyopathy. Three mothers of affected males were given a
diagnosis of definite, and two of possible, late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy.
These women presented in their 40s with atypical chest pain, and progressive
congestive heart failure developed gradually over a period of 10 or more years.
X-linked inheritance of dilated cardiomyopathy is suggested in this family by the
early onset in males, late onset in females, and no evidence of male-to-male
transmission. The late onset of the disease in females, in contrast to the early 
onset in hemizygous males, is compatible with heterozygosity for the mutant
allele. Since most cases of genetically lethal X-linked syndromes appear to be
sporadic, for every case of "idiopathic" dilated cardiomyopathy in which X-linked
inheritance can be confirmed from family information, it is possible that there
are several nonfamilial cases due to a mutation at the same locus.

Open microsurgical autograft of adrenal medulla to the right caudate nucleus in
two patients with intractable Parkinson's disease.

Madrazo I, Drucker-Colín R, Díaz V, Martínez-Mata J, Torres C, Becerril JJ.

Recent experimental studies and one clinical case have suggested that grafting
tissue from the adrenal medulla into the brain may ameliorate the signs of
Parkinson's disease. We describe the treatment of two young patients (35 and 39
years old) with intractable and incapacitating Parkinson's disease, in whom
fragments of the adrenal medulla were autotransplanted to the right caudate
nucleus. Clinical improvement was noted in both patients at 15 and 6 days
(respectively) after implantation and has continued in both. Rigidity and
akinesia had virtually disappeared in the first patient at 10 months after
surgery, and his tremor was greatly reduced. A similar degree of improvement was 
present in the second patient at three months. We conclude that autografting of
the adrenal medulla to the right caudate nucleus was associated with a marked
improvement in the signs of Parkinson's disease in two patients, but our results 
are preliminary and further work is necessary to see whether this procedure will 
be applicable over the long term in other types of patients with Parkinson's
disease.

Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: clinical, biochemical, and enzymatic studies in a
three-generation family lineage.

Toback AC, Sassa S, Poh-Fitzpatrick MB, Schechter J, Zaider E, Harber LC, Kappas 
A.

Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria is caused by a marked deficiency in the activity
of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, an enzyme that is essential for heme
biosynthesis. It has been hypothesized that uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase
deficiency is inherited as a homozygous defect in the disease. This suggestion
has been supported by reports of a deficiency of the enzyme in parents of
patients with the disorder. Further confirmation would be provided by
demonstrating a similar uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency in the
offspring of such patients. This study follows the enzymatic defect throughout
three generations of a family in which a second-generation male was shown to have
hepatoerythropoietic porphyria. Detailed biochemical and enzymatic analyses
revealed a moderate deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in both the
proband's parents and in his three children, all of whom were asymptomatic. The
mildness of the clinical symptoms in the proband correlated with a higher level
of residual enzyme activity than that in previously described patients. We
conclude that clinically manifested hepatoerythropoietic porphyria results from
the homozygous inheritance of a defect in the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase
gene, that the severity of clinical symptoms is probably related to the level of 
residual enzyme activity, and that the genetic defect of uroporphyrinogen
decarboxylase in hepatoerythropoietic porphyria can be heterogeneous.

Treatment of adenosine deaminase deficiency with polyethylene glycol-modified
adenosine deaminase.

Hershfield MS, Buckley RH, Greenberg ML, Melton AL, Schiff R, Hatem C, Kurtzberg 
J, Markert ML, Kobayashi RH, Kobayashi AL, et al.

We treated two children who had adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe
combined immunodeficiency disease by injecting bovine adenosine deaminase
modified by conjugation with polyethylene glycol. The modified enzyme was rapidly
absorbed after intramuscular injection and had a half-life in plasma of 48 to 72 
hours. Weekly doses of approximately 15 U per kilogram of body weight maintained 
plasma adenosine deaminase activity at two to three times the level of
erythrocyte adenosine deaminase activity in normal subjects. The principal
biochemical consequences of adenosine deaminase deficiency were almost completely
reversed. In erythrocytes, adenosine nucleotides increased and deoxyadenosine
nucleotides decreased to less than 0.5 percent of total adenine nucleotides. The 
activity of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, which is inactivated by
deoxyadenosine, increased to normal in red cells and nucleated marrow cells.
Neither toxic effects nor hypersensitivity reactions were observed. In vitro
tests of the cellular immune function of each patient showed marked improvement, 
along with an increase in circulating T lymphocytes. Clinical improvement was
indicated by absence of infection and resumption of weight gain. We conclude that
from the standpoints of efficacy, convenience, and safety, polyethylene
glycol-modified adenosine deaminase is preferable to red-cell transfusion as a
treatment for adenosine deaminase deficiency. Patients with other inherited
metabolic diseases in which accumulated metabolites equilibrate with plasma could
benefit from treatment with the appropriate polyethylene glycol-modified enzyme.

Human parvovirus infection in pregnancy and hydrops fetalis.

Anand A, Gray ES, Brown T, Clewley JP, Cohen BJ.

Human parvovirus is the causative agent of erythema infectiosum, a mild epidemic 
illness. In a recent outbreak in northeast Scotland, six women had serologic
evidence of having contracted human parvovirus infection during pregnancy. Two of
the women had midtrimester abortions, and both abortuses were grossly hydropic
with anemia. They had similar microscopical histopathological features--a
pronounced leukoerythroblastic reaction, hepatitis, excessive iron pigment in the
liver, and eosinophilic changes in the hematopoietic cell nuclei. Dot
hybridization with radiolabeled human parvovirus DNA probes revealed viral DNA in
several tissues from both fetuses, indicating that they had been infected by the 
virus in utero. The remaining four women had uncomplicated pregnancies and
delivered apparently healthy babies, none of whom had human parvovirus-specific
IgM antibody at delivery. We conclude that this common virus may pose a serious
risk to the fetus after maternal infection.

Exogenous reinfection with tuberculosis in a shelter for the homeless.

Nardell E, McInnis B, Thomas B, Weidhaas S.

We investigated an outbreak of tuberculosis in a large shelter for the homeless
to assess the role of exogenous reinfection as opposed to reactivation of
endogenous infection as the cause of secondary tuberculosis in this population.
Exogenous reinfection is considered relatively unimportant in the United States
and other developed countries. Of 49 shelter-related cases, 22 had cultures
resistant to both isoniazid and streptomycin and of the same phage type,
indicating recent transmission originating with a single index patient. The
probable index patient had a 10-year history of isoniazid and streptomycin
resistance--an uncommon pattern at the shelter during the three years preceding
the outbreak. In 4 of the 22 cases, the patient had previously had documented
tuberculosis infection or disease. These reinfected patients had extensive lung
cavitation and numerous acid-fast bacilli on sputum smears--features associated
with contagiousness. In contrast, patients with tuberculosis for the first time
(primary tuberculosis) are usually less contagious. We conclude that exogenous
reinfection may have been an important factor leading to highly contagious
secondary cases and an acceleration of the usual pattern of tuberculosis
transmission in this highly susceptible population.

Acute cardiac events temporally related to cocaine abuse.

Isner JM, Estes NA 3rd, Thompson PD, Costanzo-Nordin MR, Subramanian R, Miller G,
Katsas G, Sweeney K, Sturner WQ.

The increasingly widespread use of cocaine in the United States has been
accompanied and perhaps exacerbated by the misconception that the drug is not
associated with serious medical complications. In particular, the potential for
cocaine to precipitate life-threatening cardiac events needs to be reemphasized. 
We report the clinical and pathological findings in seven people in whom
nonintravenous "recreational" use of cocaine was temporally related to acute
myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, myocarditis,
sudden death, or a combination of these events. We also review data on 19
previously reported cases of cocaine-related cardiovascular disorders. Analysis
of all 26 patients indicated the following findings: the cardiac consequences of 
cocaine abuse are not unique to parenteral use of the drug, since nearly all the 
patients took the drug intranasally; underlying heart disease is not a
prerequisite for cocaine-related cardiac disorders; seizure activity, a
well-documented noncardiac complication of cocaine abuse, is neither a
prerequisite for, nor an accompanying feature of, cardiac toxicity of cocaine;
and the cardiac consequences of cocaine are not limited to massive doses of the
drug. Although the pathogenesis of cardiac toxicity of cocaine remains
incompletely defined, available circumstantial evidence suggests that cocaine has
medical consequences that are equal in importance to its well-documented
psychosocial consequences.

Mesenchymal cystic hamartoma of the lung.

Mark EJ.

Mesenchymal hamartomatous nodules and cysts in the lungs caused hemoptysis,
pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea of slight or moderate
degree, or a combination of these signs and symptoms in five patients. In four
cases the disease was multifocal and bilateral. The nodules were composed of
primitive mesenchymal cells subdivided into papillae by a plexus of small airways
lined with respiratory epithelium. The nodules grew slowly in number and size
over the years and apparently became cystic when they reached a diameter of about
1 cm. The cysts had a cambium layer of mesenchymal cells and were lined with
normal or metaplastic respiratory epithelium. In general, the disease had an
indolent course. The most serious complications were sudden hemorrhage into a
cyst from large systemic arteries supplying the walls of the cysts, pneumothorax 
or hemothorax from rupture of a subpleural cyst, and malignant transformation in 
one case. This disease appears to represent a distinct clinicopathological
entity, which I term mesenchymal cystic hamartoma of the lung.

The effects of chloroquine on serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium
metabolism in sarcoidosis.

O'Leary TJ, Jones G, Yip A, Lohnes D, Cohanim M, Yendt ER.

Although corticosteroids are effective in the treatment of hypercalciuria and
hypercalcemia in chronic sarcoidosis, complications of their long-term use
frequently limit therapy. We studied the efficacy of chloroquine in two patients 
with sarcoidosis who were unable to tolerate the dosage of corticosteroids
required to control hypercalciuria and prevent the formation of renal stones.
Over a three-year period, each patient received a 6-month and a 10-month course
of oral chloroquine phosphate (500 mg per day) while continuing to receive
corticosteroids at a fixed dose. Chloroquine therapy was associated with a
significant reduction in levels of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) and
urinary calcium. We observed a direct correlation between serum 1,25-(OH)2D
levels and 24-hour urinary calcium excretion, supporting the hypothesis that
excessive serum 1,25-(OH)2D is responsible for the hypercalciuria in sarcoidosis.
Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) did not change with therapy,
suggesting that chloroquine may act by inhibiting the conversion of 25-(OH)D to
1,25-(OH)2D. Current dosage guidelines and ophthalmologic-surveillance
techniques, which allow chloroquine to be administered with little risk of
retinopathy, should permit an expanded role for this agent in the treatment of
the calcium abnormalities of sarcoidosis.

Fumarase deficiency: a new cause of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.

Zinn AB, Kerr DS, Hoppel CL.

We observed a deficiency of both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of
fumarase in a male infant with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy who presented at
one month of age with failure to thrive, developmental delay, hypotonia, cerebral
atrophy, lactic and pyruvic acidemia, and fumaric aciduria. The patient died at
eight months of age. Isolated skeletal-muscle mitochondria showed selective
defects in the oxidation of glutamate (31 ng atoms of oxygen consumed per minute 
per milligram of mitochondrial protein, as compared with 94 +/- 19 [mean +/- SD] 
in five controls) and of succinate (18 vs. 145 +/- 18 ng atoms of oxygen per
minute per milligram of protein), whereas isolated liver mitochondria oxidized
these and other substrates normally. Fumarase activity was virtually absent in
both liver mitochondria (53 vs. 2878 +/- 248 nmol per minute per milligram of
protein [5 controls]) and skeletal-muscle mitochondria (23 vs. 1997 +/- 717 nmol 
per minute per milligram [12 controls]). Seventeen other mitochondrial enzymes
had normal activity in both liver and muscle mitochondrial extracts. Fumarase
activity was also significantly reduced in homogenates of liver tissue (less than
1 vs. 90 +/- 25 mumol per minute per gram of wet weight [five controls]) and
skeletal muscle (less than 1 vs. 21 +/- 4 mumol per minute per gram [five
controls]), indicating a deficiency of both mitochondrial and cytosolic
fumarases. Organ differences in intramitochondrial accumulation of fumarate may
have accounted for the selective oxidative defects observed in the
skeletal-muscle mitochondria but not liver mitochondria. All these findings are
consistent with a profound combined fumarase deficiency.

Brain neurotransmitters in dystonia musculorum deformans.

Hornykiewicz O, Kish SJ, Becker LE, Farley I, Shannak K.

We examined histologically and biochemically the brains of two patients with
generalized childhood-onset dystonia musculorum deformans. We found no important 
histologic changes in the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, higher brain-stem
nuclei, locus ceruleus, or raphe nuclei. Similarly, the activity of choline
acetyltransferase and the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamic acid in 
the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia were within the control range. In contrast,
the norepinephrine concentrations were markedly and consistently decreased in the
lateral and posterior hypothalamus, mamillary body, subthalamic nucleus, and
locus ceruleus. The serotonin level was subnormal in the dorsal raphe nucleus, as
was the dopamine level in the nucleus accumbens and, in one of the two cases, in 
the striatum. Elevated concentrations of norepinephrine were found in the septum,
thalamus, colliculi, red nucleus, and dorsal raphe nucleus; of serotonin, in the 
globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and locus ceruleus; and of
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and
nuclei raphe centralis inferior and obscurus. The level of homovanillic acid
showed little consistent change in the regions examined. We conclude that some of
these monoamine changes, especially the pronounced apparent disturbance of
noradrenergic brain mechanisms, may represent a basic neurochemical abnormality
in dystonia musculorum deformans and may thus be relevant to the
pathoneurophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

A new Chlamydia psittaci strain, TWAR, isolated in acute respiratory tract
infections.

Grayston JT, Kuo CC, Wang SP, Altman J.

During a 2 1/2-year period, we studied 386 University of Washington students with
acute respiratory disease, to determine whether a Chlamydia psittaci strain, here
designated TWAR, is an important respiratory pathogen. Serologic evidence of
recent TWAR infection was found in 13 students, and the organism was isolated
from 8 of these. TWAR infection occurred in 12 percent of the students who had
pneumonia (9 of 76), 5 percent of those with bronchitis (3 of 63), and 1 percent 
of those with pharyngitis (1 of 150). The TWAR infections occurred throughout the
study period. Pharyngitis, often accompanied by laryngitis, was a common first
symptom. Clinically, the infections resembled those with Myco-plasma pneumoniae; 
therefore, the patients were given courses of erythromycin used for the treatment
of M. pneumoniae infections. This therapy proved to be inadequate. The limited
data available suggest that the TWAR strain is a "human" C. psittaci that is
spread from human to human, without a bird or animal host.

Death-scene investigation in sudden infant death.

Bass M, Kravath RE, Glass L.

We conducted death-scene investigations in 26 consecutive cases in which a
presumptive diagnosis of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) was made and the
infants were brought to the emergency room of the Kings County Hospital Center
between October 1983 and January 1985. In six cases, we observed strong
circumstantial evidence of accidental death. In 18 other cases, we discovered
various possible causes of death other than SIDS, including accidental
asphyxiation by an object in the crib or bassinet, smothering by overlying while 
sharing a bed, hyperthermia, and shaken baby syndrome. This study suggests that
many sudden deaths of infants have a definable cause that can be revealed by
careful investigation of the death scene and that the extremely high rate of SIDS
(4.2 per 1000 live births) reported in the population of low socioeconomic status
served by Kings County Hospital Center should be questioned.

Mevalonic aciduria--an inborn error of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprene
biosynthesis.

Hoffmann G, Gibson KM, Brandt IK, Bader PI, Wappner RS, Sweetman L.

A two-year-old boy presented with severe failure to thrive, developmental delay, 
anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, central cataracts, and dysmorphic features.
Quantitative analyses of urinary organic acids revealed massive excretion of
mevalonic acid, a metabolic precursor of cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenes:
46,000 to 56,200 mmol per mole of creatinine, as compared with 0.2 to 0.3 mmol
per mole in normal children. The mevalonic acid concentration in plasma was also 
greatly increased at 440 mumol per liter (normal, less than 0.05). The activity
of mevalonate kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in mevalonate
metabolism, was severely deficient in the patient's fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and
lymphoblasts. In the subsequent pregnancy of the patient's mother, gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated a marked elevation of mevalonic
acid in the mother's urine and a 3000-fold elevation, as compared with control
levels in the amniotic fluid, suggesting that the fetus was affected. The
diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of the deficiency of mevalonate kinase
in amniocytes and ultimately in liver from the abortus. Intermediate activities
of the enzyme in both parents indicated an autosomal recessive mode of
inheritance. These observations identify an inherited disorder of cholesterol and
nonsterol isoprene biosynthesis in humans.

Familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Evidence of lung inflammation in
unaffected family members.

Bitterman PB, Rennard SI, Keogh BA, Wewers MD, Adelberg S, Crystal RG.

We evaluated 17 clinically unaffected members of three families with an autosomal
dominant form of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for evidence of alveolar
inflammation. Each person in the study was examined by gallium-67 scanning for a 
general estimate of pulmonary inflammation, and by bronchoalveolar lavage for
characterization of the types of recovered cells and their state of activation.
Eight of the 17 subjects had evidence of alveolar inflammation on the lavage
studies. Supporting data included increased numbers of neutrophils and activated 
macrophages that released one or more neutrophil chemoattractants, and growth
factors for lung fibroblasts--findings similar to those observed in patients with
overt idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Four of these eight also had a positive
gallium scan; in all the other clinically unaffected subjects the scan was
normal. During a follow-up of two to four years in seven of the eight subjects
who had evidence of inflammation, no clinical evidence of pulmonary fibrosis has 
appeared. These results indicate that alveolar inflammation occurs in
approximately half the clinically unaffected family members at risk of inheriting
autosomal dominant idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Whether these persons with
evidence of pulmonary inflammation but no fibrosis will proceed to have
clinically evident pulmonary fibrosis is not yet known.

Molecular analysis of the inheritance of phenylketonuria and mild

Clinical phenylketonuria and mild hyperphenylalaninemia represent two different
phenotypes of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. To determine the genetic
relation between these two phenotypes, we studied two families in which one
member had phenylketonuria and other members had mild hyperphenylalaninemia. We
identified restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms that differentiated the four
phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in each family. Phenylketonuria and mild
hyperphenylalaninemia were found to be allelic; certain pairs of alleles induced 
the more severe phenylketonuria phenotype, and other pairs induced the less
severe hyperphenylalaninemia phenotype. Several of the alleles that were
identified can contribute to either phenylketonuria or mild
hyperphenylalaninemia. These results demonstrate that there are multiple and
distinct mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, with different levels
of severity, and that various combinations of the mutant alleles can result in
different phenotypes of the metabolic disorders of hyperphenylalaninemia.

Unilateral lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis.

Toronto Lung Transplant Group.

Improvements in immunosuppression and surgical techniques have made unilateral
lung transplantation feasible in selected patients with end-stage interstitial
lung disease. We report two cases of successful unilateral lung transplantation
for end-stage respiratory failure due to pulmonary fibrosis. The patients, both
oxygen-dependent, had progressive disease refractory to all treatment, with an
anticipated life expectancy of less than one year on the basis of the rate of
progression of the disease. Both patients were discharged six weeks after
transplantation and returned to normal life. They are alive and well at 26 months
and 14 months after the procedure. Pulmonary-function studies have shown
substantial improvement in their lung volumes and diffusing capacities. For both 
patients, arterial oxygen tension is now normal and there is no arterial oxygen
desaturation with exercise. This experience shows that unilateral lung
transplantation, for selected patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease, 
provides a good functional result. Moreover, it avoids the necessity for cardiac 
transplantation, as required by the combined heart-lung procedure, and permits
the use of the donor heart for another recipient.

Acute epiglottitis in adults. An eight-year experience in the state of Rhode
Island.

MayoSmith MF, Hirsch PJ, Wodzinski SF, Schiffman FJ.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records on all cases of acute
epiglottitis in adults from each of the hospitals in Rhode Island and from the
state medical examiner's office over an eight-year period (1975-1982). We found
56 cases--an annual incidence of 9.7 cases per million adults. A significant
increase occurred in the last two study years. Indirect laryngoscopy proved to be
more reliable in making a diagnosis than did x-ray films of the neck; all of 41
indirect examinations were performed without complications. Twenty-three percent 
(6 of 26) of patients in whom blood cultures had been obtained had bacteremia,
all with Hemophilus influenzae. Bacteremia was associated with a high risk of
airway obstruction. Four patients died, all from acute airway obstruction, for a 
mortality rate of 7.1 percent--a rate significantly higher than the current rate 
among children. Two deaths occurred after admission, while the patients were
being observed without an artificial airway. We conclude that the incidence of
epiglottitis in adults is higher than previously believed and may be increasing. 
Fatal airway obstruction can occur without warning, indicating a need for early
protection of the airway in adults as well as in children.

Further evidence that "malignant angioendotheliomatosis" is an angiotropic
large-cell lymphoma.

Sheibani K, Battifora H, Winberg CD, Burke JS, Ben-Ezra J, Ellinger GM, Quigley
NJ, Fernandez BB, Morrow D, Rappaport H.

Malignant angioendotheliomatosis is a rare, generally fatal disease characterized
by a multifocal proliferation of neoplastic mononuclear cells within the lumens
of small blood vessels. Although the disease primarily involves the vasculature
of the skin and central nervous system, vascular involvement of other organs may 
occur and may produce a variety of clinical findings. Some early investigators
concluded that malignant angioendotheliomatosis was a neoplasm of endothelial
cells, but recently others have suggested that it is of hematopoietic origin. We 
have studied three patients with the disease and have characterized the
immunophenotype of the neoplasm on cryostat-cut fresh-frozen tissues. A detailed 
antigenic phenotyping of neoplastic lymphoid cells showed that one patient had
the immunophenotype T11+, Leu-1+, Leu-3+, Leu-2+, B1-, B2-, SIg-, LN1-, LN2-, the
predominant phenotype for peripheral T-cell lymphoma; the others had T11-,
Leu-1-, Leu-3-, Leu-2-, B1+, B2+, SIg+, LN1+, LN2+, consistent with a
B-cell-derived lymphoma. On the basis of our results, we suggest that angiotropic
(intravascular) large-cell lymphoma would be more appropriate than malignant
angioendotheliomatosis as a name for this disease.

Natural history of symptomatic partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Rowe PC, Newman SL, Brusilow SW.

We reviewed the natural history and differential diagnosis of ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency (an X-linked inborn error of urea synthesis) in 13
symptomatic female heterozygotes. The patients presented as early as the first
week of life or as late as the sixth year. The most common symptoms before
diagnosis were nonspecific: episodic extreme irritability (100 percent), episodic
vomiting and lethargy (100 percent), protein avoidance (92 percent), ataxia (77
percent), Stage II coma (46 percent), delayed physical growth (38 percent),
developmental delay (38 percent), and seizures (23 percent). Including the
proband, 42 percent of the female members of the 13 families studied had
symptoms. The median interval between the onset of major symptoms (vomiting and
lethargy, seizures, and coma) and diagnosis was 16 months (range, 1 to 142). Five
patients had IQ scores below 70 at the time of diagnosis. We suggest that careful
evaluation of the family history, the dietary history, the episodic nature of the
nonspecific symptoms, the response of these symptoms to the withdrawal of
protein, and their frequent onset at the time of weaning from breast milk will
permit early diagnosis and might thereby reduce the risk of death or neurologic
impairment in female patients with partial ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.

Embryonic zeta-globin chains in adults: a marker for alpha-thalassemia-1
haplotype due to a greater than 17.5-kb deletion.

Chui DH, Wong SC, Chung SW, Patterson M, Bhargava S, Poon MC.

Hemolysates from adults with the alpha-thalassemia-1 haplotype due to the greater
than 17.5-kb deletion of both alpha-globin genes from the same chromosome were
found to contain embryonic zeta (zeta)-globin chains (alpha-globin-like chains), 
as determined by a specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay and an electrophoretic
technique. zeta-Globin chains were not present in hemolysates from adults with
deletion of a single alpha-globin gene from one or both chromosomes. These
results indicate that zeta-globin chains, which can be assayed by immunologic
techniques, can serve as markers for the alpha-thalassemia-1 haplotype due to the
greater than 17.5-kb deletion. The ability to detect zeta-globin chains may be
useful in populations in which the gene frequency of the greater than 17.5-kb
deletion is high, for screening couples at risk of having offspring with
homozygous alpha-thalassemia.

Isolation of HTLV-III from cerebrospinal fluid and neural tissues of patients
with neurologic syndromes related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Ho DD, Rota TR, Schooley RT, Kaplan JC, Allan JD, Groopman JE, Resnick L,
Felsenstein D, Andrews CA, Hirsch MS.

We conducted virus-isolation studies on 56 specimens from the nervous system of
45 patients in order to determine whether human T-cell lymphotropic virus Type
III (HTLV-III) is directly involved in the pathogenesis of the neurologic
disorders frequently encountered in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
and the AIDS-related complex. We recovered HTLV-III from at least one specimen
from 24 of 33 patients with AIDS-related neurologic syndromes. In one patient,
HTLV-III was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid during acute aseptic
meningitis associated with HTLV-III seroconversion. HTLV-III was also isolated
from cerebrospinal fluid from six of seven patients with AIDS or its related
complex and unexplained chronic meningitis. In addition, of 16 patients with
AIDS-related dementia, 10 had positive cultures for HTLV-III in cerebrospinal
fluid, brain tissue, or both. Furthermore, we cultured HTLV-III from the spinal
cord of a patient with myelopathy and from the sural nerve of a patient with
peripheral neuropathy. These findings suggest that HTLV-III is neurotropic, is
capable of causing acute meningitis, is responsible for AIDS-related chronic
meningitis and dementia, and may be the cause of the spinal-cord degeneration and
peripheral neuropathy in AIDS and AIDS-related complex.

Male pseudohermaphroditism due to multiple defects in steroid-biosynthetic
microsomal mixed-function oxidases. A new variant of congenital adrenal
hyperplasia.

Peterson RE, Imperato-McGinley J, Gautier T, Shackleton C.

A six-month-old 46,XY infant with a female phenotype and ambiguous genitalia was 
evaluated for male pseudohermaphroditism. The principal findings were (1) low
basal plasma levels of all measured C19 steroids and their sulfates, which were
unchanged or only minimally increased after stimulation with human chorionic
gonadotropin or ACTH, (2) no urinary metabolites of C19 11-deoxy steroids, and
decreased amounts of C19 11-oxosteroids, (3) normal basal plasma cortisol levels 
and normal urinary excretion of cortisol metabolites, (4) high plasma
corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone levels and elevated urinary excretion of
their metabolites, (5) high plasma progesterone and pregnenolone levels and
increased urinary excretion of pregnanediol and pregnenediol, (6) high plasma 17 
alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 21-deoxycortisol levels and increased urinary
excretion of pregnanetriol, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnanolone, and pregnenetriolone,
(7) high plasma and urinary levels of 5-pregnene-3 beta,20 alpha-diol sulfate,
(8) low plasma levels of 21-hydroxy-pregnenolone and 5-pregnene-3 beta,17 alpha, 
20 alpha-triol sulfate, (9) high plasma ACTH levels, and (10) suppression of the 
high plasma steroid levels by dexamethasone. The unusual pattern of plasma and
urinary steroids indicated that this child had multiple abnormalities of
steroid-biosynthetic microsomal mixed-function oxidases--21-hydroxylase, 17
alpha-hydroxylase, and 17,20 desmolase. The deficit in the activities of the
first two enzymes resulted in decreased cortisol synthesis with subsequent
increased ACTH secretion and adrenocortical hyperplasia. The male
pseudohermaphroditism resulted from deficient testosterone synthesis due to
deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20 desmolase. The mother and two
sisters of the affected child had evidence of mild 17 alpha-hydroxylase
deficiency.

Aldosterone-receptor deficiency in pseudohypoaldosteronism.

Armanini D, Kuhnle U, Strasser T, Dorr H, Butenandt I, Weber PC, Stockigt JR,
Pearce P, Funder JW.

Pseudohypoaldosteronism, a syndrome characterized by salt wasting and failure to 
thrive, usually presents in infancy as high urinary levels of sodium despite
hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperreninemia, and elevated aldosterone levels. We
have investigated this syndrome for the possibility of abnormal Type I or
"mineralocorticoid-like" receptors, which have intrinsic steroid specificity
indistinguishable from that of renal mineralocorticoid receptors and are found in
many tissues and cells, including mononuclear leukocytes. We have studied three
patients with pseudohypoaldosteronism: the 28-year-old index case in Melbourne
(Patient 1) and two siblings in Munich, eight and two years of age (Patients 2
and 3); clinically, Patient 3 had a less severe case than his sister.
Percoll-separated control monocytes bound [3H]aldosterone with high affinity (Kd 
approximately 3 nM) and limited capacity (150 to 600 sites per cell). On repeated
examination, no [3H]aldosterone binding was found in monocytes from Patients 1
and 2; in Patient 3, the levels were 62 sites per cell, more than 2 S.D. below
those of the control. Levels in the parents of the Munich patients (first
cousins) were normal. It appears that pseudohypoaldosteronism is caused by a Type
I receptor defect, that the defect may be complete or partial, that transmission 
may be autosomal recessive, and that the study of patients with
pseudohypoaldosteronism may indicate physiologic roles for Type I receptors in
nonepithelial tissues.

In situ characterization of autoimmune phenomena and expression of HLA molecules 
in the pancreas in diabetic insulitis.

Bottazzo GF, Dean BM, McNally JM, MacKay EH, Swift PG, Gamble DR.

After the death of a 12-year old girl with newly discovered insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, we used monoclonal antibodies in an effort to identify the
cells invading the pancreas. The majority of infiltrating lymphocytes were of the
T cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype, but other T-cell subpopulations were present.
Some of the T cells were "activated" (positive for HLA-DR antigen, and the
interleukin-2 receptor). Immunocytes bearing IgG were scattered in the gland, and
complement-fixing IgG antibodies were deposited in some islets. Increased
expression of Class I (HLA-A, B, and C) molecules was observed in the affected
islet cells, and in damaged islets showing scant lymphocytic infiltration, some
beta cells (still producing insulin), but not glucagon or somatostatin cells,
were HLA-DR positive. The capillary endothelium was markedly dilated and strongly
HLA-DR positive. These findings may contribute to an understanding of the
sequence of events leading to the destruction of beta cells in classic Type I
diabetes mellitus.

Clinical findings in four children with biotinidase deficiency detected through a
statewide neonatal screening program.

Wolf B, Heard GS, Jefferson LG, Proud VK, Nance WE, Weissbecker KA.

Four children with biotinidase deficiency were identified during the first year
of a neonatal screening program for this disease in the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Two unrelated probands were identified among the 81,243 newborn infants who were 
screened. In addition, two siblings of one of these infants were found to be
affected. Both probands had mild neurologic symptoms at two and four months,
respectively, and the two older children had more severe neurologic
abnormalities, cutaneous findings, and developmental delay at two and three years
of age. However, none of the affected children had acute metabolic
decompensation. Previous studies have shown that the administration of biotin to 
affected children can be a lifesaving procedure that can reverse acute symptoms
and prevent irreversible neurologic damage. Our findings demonstrate that subtle 
neurologic abnormalities may appear as early as at two months of age and that
developmental abnormalities may occur even in the absence of episodes of overt
metabolic decompensation. Since screening and treatment are both inexpensive and 
effective and the incidence of the disease is well within the range of that of
other metabolic diseases for which screening is performed, biotinidase deficiency
should be added to the group of metabolic diseases for which screening is done in
the neonatal period.

Emergence of idiotype variants during treatment of B-cell lymphoma with
anti-idiotype antibodies.

Meeker T, Lowder J, Cleary ML, Stewart S, Warnke R, Sklar J, Levy R.

We studied two patients with malignant B-cell lymphoma that manifested resistance
to the therapeutic effects of anti-idiotype antibody because of the emergence of 
subclones with changes in their immunoglobulin idiotypes. In both patients,
tumor-cell populations arose that were unreactive with anti-idiotype antibody but
that retained surface immunoglobulin. One of the patients had an additional
subpopulation of tumor cells that had switched from mu to gamma heavy-chain
expression. Study of the immunoglobulin genes in the tumors confirmed that the
subpopulations were derived from the same original clone of neoplastic B cells in
each patient. The available data suggest that the idiotypic variation observed
was the result of somatic mutation in the variable region of the active
immunoglobulin genes. The fact that such mutations became evident over a short
time and in the context of a partial tumor response suggests that the antibody
therapy exerted a strong selective force against tumor cells that expressed the
idiotype determinant. Multiple anti-idiotype antibodies may therefore be needed
to identify all cells of a malignant clone, and some patients may require
treatment with more than one monoclonal antibody.

Spontaneous alteration of idiotype in a monoclonal B-cell lymphoma. Escape from
detection by anti-idiotype.

Raffeld M, Neckers L, Longo DL, Cossman J.

The surface immunoglobulin of B-cell neoplasms provides a specific point of
attack for potential antibody therapy. The capacity of anti-idiotype antibody to 
home to the target neoplasm requires that the idiotype be unique and that it be
expressed by every cell in the neoplastic clone. We describe the evolution of an 
altered idiotype in a follicular lymphoma that resulted in escape from laboratory
detection by monoclonal anti-idiotype antibody. This was not due to the emergence
of a second (biclonal) lymphoma, since all the neoplastic cells were otherwise
identical both phenotypically and genotypically, as determined by flow cytometry 
and genomic DNA (Southern blot) hybridization, respectively. All cells expressed 
the same B-cell immunotype and bore a constant amount of IgMk. The demonstration 
of a single configuration of immunoglobulin-gene DNA confirmed monoclonality and 
established that the change in idiotype was not a result of new gene
rearrangements but was more likely due to somatic mutation of the variable
region--a process presumed to occur naturally in B cells. These data demonstrate 
the lability of idiotype expression and define a mechanism by which B-cell
neoplasms may become unresponsive to anti-idiotype therapy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus with deficiency of the T4 epitope on T
helper/inducer cells.

Stohl W, Crow MK, Kunkel HG.

Three black Jamaicans with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were identified
whose T helper/inducer cells lacked the T4 epitope (T4 epitope-deficient
phenotype). All three patients had lymphadenopathy as part of their syndromes.
The asymptomatic and otherwise healthy T4 epitope-deficient brother of one of
these patients also had lymphadenopathy in a distribution identical to that of
his sister with SLE. Family studies pointed to an autosomal codominant mode of
inheritance not linked to the HLA locus for the T4 epitope phenotype. Cultures of
peripheral-blood mononuclear cells revealed impaired B-cell differentiation upon 
stimulation with pokeweed mitogen in cells originating from the T4
epitope-deficient family members as compared with those originating from their T4
epitope-intermediate relatives. Ratios of T helper/inducer cells to T
suppressor/cytotoxic cells, the presence of various autoantibodies, and
proliferation in response to mitogens and in the mixed lymphocyte reactions did
not correlate with T4 epitope phenotype. We suggest that SLE in association with 
the T4 epitope-deficient phenotype may represent a unique subset of patients with
SLE that has distinct clinical and immunologic properties.

Isolated gonadotrope failure in the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome.

Barkan AL, Kelch RP, Marshall JC.

Hypogonadism is a component of the polyglandular autoimmune syndromes and usually
results from primary gonadal failure. Isolated gonadotropin deficiency is a
disorder of prepubertal onset that usually results from a failure of hypothalamic
secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). We describe here two men with
polyglandular autoimmune syndrome and isolated gonadotropin deficiency acquired
after puberty. Plasma levels of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
hormone in response to bolus doses of GnRH and to pulsatile GnRH injections (25
ng per kilogram of body weight intravenously every two hours) over a four-day
period were subnormal. Pituitary secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone,
prolactin, growth hormone, and ACTH was not impaired. These data indicate that
isolated gonadotropin deficiency may result from a selective pituitary
gonadotrope failure. In addition, they suggest that autoimmune hypophysitis may
be an integral part of the polyglandular autoimmune syndrome and can be
selective, involving only one type of pituitary cells.

Genotyping with DNA probes in combined immunodeficiency syndrome with defective
expression of HLA.

Marcadet A, Cohen D, Dausset J, Fischer A, Durandy A, Griscelli C.

We performed HLA genotyping by using restriction-enzyme fragments hybridized with
specific HLA probes instead of traditional immunologic methods in two patients
whose lymphocytes expressed so few HLA antigens on the cell surface that
serologic methods failed. Segregation of restriction-fragment-length polymorphism
permitted identification of the genotypes. In addition, known correlations
between serologically determined antigens and restriction-fragment-length
polymorphism were confirmed. We applied this approach in making therapeutic
decisions regarding bone marrow transplantation.

Epstein-Barr virus-associated B-cell proliferations of diverse clonal origins
after bone marrow transplantation in a 12-year-old patient with severe combined
immunodeficiency.

Shearer WT, Ritz J, Finegold MJ, Guerra IC, Rosenblatt HM, Lewis DE, Pollack MS, 
Taber LH, Sumaya CV, Grumet FC, et al.

A 12-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency who had been kept in a
gnotobiotic environment since birth received bone marrow from a histoincompatible
sibling in an attempt to reconstitute immunologic function. To prevent graft
versus host disease, the donor's marrow was treated in vitro with monoclonal
antibody and complement to remove alloreactive T cells. Eighty days after
transplantation, the patient had a systemic illness characterized by fever,
thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal pain, and bleeding; he died on the 124th
post-transplantation day. Postmortem examination revealed multiple tumor-like
B-cell proliferations, recipient in origin, in numerous organs. Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) was isolated from the patient's pharyngeal secretions; EBV nuclear
antigen was found in spontaneously transformed peripheral-blood lymphocytes,
inflammatory cells from peritoneal fluid, and bone marrow cells; and EBV genomes 
were discovered in all tumor tissues. The donor's serum showed evidence of past
EBV infection. Analysis of cellular immunoglobulin and immunoglobulin gene DNA
from the tumors indicated both monoclonal and oligoclonal B-cell proliferations. 
These findings provide evidence for the evolution of EBV-induced polyclonal
activation of B cells to oligoclonal B-cell proliferation and finally to
monoclonal B-cell lymphoma.

Response to a physiologic dose of pyridoxine in type I primary hyperoxaluria.

Yendt ER, Cohanim M.

We measured urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion before and during pyridoxine 
administration (2 to 200 mg per day) in four patients with primary hyperoxaluria.
In two patients with type I primary hyperoxaluria, urinary oxalate and glycolate 
excretion fell markedly in response to a physiologic dose of pyridoxine of 2 mg
per day and became completely normal when the dose was increased to 25 mg per
day. In the other two patients, who had a different type of primary hyperoxaluria
(normal urinary glycolate excretion), there was no response to 2 mg of pyridoxine
per day. In one of these patients, doses of 25 and 50 mg per day were also
ineffective, but a moderate reduction in oxalate excretion took place with 200 mg
per day; in the other patient there was a moderate reduction in oxalate excretion
with 25 mg of pyridoxine per day. Our findings suggest that the degree of
hyperoxaluria in this disorder may be only slight or moderate if the patient has 
been ingesting a pyridoxine-rich diet or multivitamin tablets containing small
amounts of pyridoxine. Our results also suggest that smaller doses of pyridoxine 
than those heretofore employed should be tried in patients with primary
hyperoxaluria.

Acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency associated with antiidiotypic antibody to
monoclonal immunoglobulins.

Geha RS, Quinti I, Austen KF, Cicardi M, Sheffer A, Rosen FS.

The syndrome of acquired angioedema and C1-inhibitor deficiency is associated
with B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. It is characterized by accelerated
consumption of C1q and C1 inhibitor in vivo and by low levels of serum C2 and C4.
Four patients with B-cell malignant diseases (IgA myeloma, macroglobulinemia,
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and B-cell lymphoma, respectively) and acquired
C1-inhibitor deficiency were found to have circulating antiidiotypic antibodies
to the monoclonal immunoglobulin expressed on the surface of their B cells (three
patients) or in the cytoplasm of their bone-marrow cells (one patient). Two of
the four patients had circulating M components, and their antiidiotypic
antibodies reacted with the M components. In three patients studied the
percentage of B cells bearing C1q was 18, 24, and 35 per cent, as compared with
2.3 +/- 1.7 per cent (mean +/- S.D.) in six normal controls. These results
suggest that an interaction between the idiotype of monoclonal immunoglobulins
and antiidiotypic antibodies causes increased consumption of C1q and C1 inhibitor
in patients with acquired angioedema and C1-inhibitor deficiency. We propose that
the subsequent activation of the early components of complement leads to
increased vascular permeability and to angioedema and that these patients have a 
disease caused by antiidiotypic antibodies.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion proteins in human brains.

Bockman JM, Kingsbury DT, McKinley MP, Bendheim PE, Prusiner SB.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by a slow infectious pathogen, or prion. We
found that purified fractions from the brains of two patients with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease contained protease-resistant proteins ranging in
apparent molecular weight from 10,000 to 50,000. These proteins reacted with
antibodies raised against the scrapie prion protein PrP 27-30. Rod-shaped
particles were found in the brain tissue of the patients that were similar to
those isolated from rodents with either scrapie or experimental Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. After being stained with Congo red dye, the protein polymers from
patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease exhibited green birefringence when
examined under polarized light. Our findings suggest that the amyloid plaques
found in the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may be composed of

Acceleration of growth in two children treated with human growth
hormone-releasing factor.

Thorner MO, Reschke J, Chitwood J, Rogol AD, Furlanetto R, Rivier J, Vale W,
Blizzard RM.

Two growth hormone-deficient children were treated with growth hormone-releasing 
factor for six months. The pattern of administration--1 to 3 micrograms per
kilogram of body weight, given subcutaneously over one minute every three hours
by infusion pump--was chosen to simulate growth hormone secretion in normal
children. During the first week of therapy, both children had evidence of the
metabolic effects of increased growth hormone secretion--i.e., nitrogen
retention, demonstrated by decreased nitrogen excretion (P less than 0.05), and
increased urinary calcium excretion (P less than 0.01). Growth hormone secretion 
was increased after pulses of growth hormone-releasing factor during the entire
six-month period, and growth was accelerated. One child grew at a rate of 7.1 cm 
per year, as compared with 4.6 cm per year before therapy; the other grew at a
rate of 13.7 cm per year, as compared with 2.1 cm per year before therapy, and
had increased serum levels of somatomedin C. Growth hormone--releasing factor can
restore growth hormone secretion and its biologic effects, including an increase 
in nitrogen retention, an increase in serum somatomedin C, and acceleration of
linear growth in children with growth hormone deficiency. It is premature to
speculate how useful this agent will prove to be in the treatment of children
with growth hormone deficiency.

Liver transplantation to provide low-density-lipoprotein receptors and lower
plasma cholesterol in a child with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Bilheimer DW, Goldstein JL, Grundy SM, Starzl TE, Brown MS.

A six-year-old girl with severe hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis had two 
defective genes at the low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor locus, as
determined by biochemical studies of cultured fibroblasts. One gene, inherited
from the mother, produced no LDL receptors; the other gene, inherited from the
father, produced a receptor precursor that was not transported to the cell
surface and was unable to bind LDL. The patient degraded intravenously
administered 125I-LDL at an extremely low rate, indicating that her high plasma
LDL-cholesterol level was caused by defective receptor-mediated removal of LDL
from plasma. After transplantation of a liver and a heart from a normal donor,
the patient's plasma LDL-cholesterol level declined by 81 per cent, from 988 to
184 mg per deciliter. The fractional catabolic rate for intravenously
administered 125I-LDL, a measure of functional LDL receptors in vivo, increased
by 2.5-fold. Thus, the transplanted liver, with its normal complement of LDL
receptors, was able to remove LDL cholesterol from plasma at a nearly normal
rate. We conclude that a genetically determined deficiency of LDL receptors can
be largely reversed by liver transplantation. These data underscore the
importance of hepatic LDL receptors in controlling the plasma level of LDL
cholesterol in human beings.

Bone-marrow transplantation in the Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis
type VI). Biochemical and clinical status 24 months after transplantation.

Krivit W, Pierpont ME, Ayaz K, Tsai M, Ramsay NK, Kersey JH, Weisdorf S, Sibley
R, Snover D, McGovern MM, et al.

A 13-year-old girl with the severe form of the Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome
(mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI, arylsulfatase B deficiency) has had successful
reconstitution with bone marrow from her HLA-MLC-matched sister who had normal
arylsulfatase B activity. Full engraftment has been present for 24 months. The
following biochemical and clinical changes have occurred: arylsulfatase B
activity in peripheral lymphocytes and granulocytes increased to normal levels,
and the activity in serial liver-biopsy specimens increased from about 3 per cent
of the mean normal level 43 days after transplantation to about 16 per cent at
600 days. Urinary excretion of acid mucopolysaccharide decreased. Ultrastructural
evidence of accumulated dermatan sulfate was no longer detectable in bone-marrow 
cells; in peripheral-blood lymphocytes, granulocytes, or platelets; or in Ito
cells of liver. Twenty-four months after engraftment, hepatosplenomegaly was
substantially decreased and cardiopulmonary function was normal. Visual acuity
and joint mobility were also improved. The patient returned to school and
continued to perform well in academic studies. Thus, bone-marrow transplantation 
provided a source of enzymatically normal cells, which have altered the metabolic
and clinical course of the disease.

Virologic studies in a case of transfusion-associated AIDS.

Groopman JE, Salahuddin SZ, Sarngadharan MG, Mullins JI, Sullivan JL, Mulder C,
O'Hara CJ, Cheeseman SH, Haverkos H, Forgacs P, et al.

PIP: The authors present the case of a 60-year old woman who developed acquired
immunedeficiency syndrome (AIDS) 43 months after a blood transfusion. The blood
donor was identified as a sexually active homosexual man who frequently used
intravenous drugs. Although he was asymptomatic, physical examination revealed
generalized lymphadenopathy of cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. 47 months 
after his blood donation, the donor underwent lymph node biopsy which revealed
follicular hyperplasia. He was seropositive for antibodies to human
T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) and had serologic evidence of prior
infection with cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and hepatitis B virus. On the
other hand, he had a normal total lymphocyte count and normal T-cell subsets.
Striking was the difference between the seropositivity of the high-risk donor and
the seronegativity of the patient with transfusion-associated AIDS with respect
to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and hepatitis B virus. The demonstration 
of apparent transmission of HTLV-III by blood transfusion and the inability to
detect evidence of infection with other viruses strongly indicate a primary
etiologic role for this virus in the pathogenesis of AIDS. The high-risk blood
donor continues to be an asymptomatic carrier of HTLV-III. The authors are
currently comparing the HTLV-III isolates obtained from the blood donor with the 
HTLV-III-related RNA sequences detected in the spleen of the patient in order to 
determine whether molecular changes occurred after transmission of the virus that
might be related to the development of AIDS.

Right-sided infective endocarditis as a consequence of flow-directed
pulmonary-artery catheterization. A clinicopathological study of 55 autopsied
patients.

Rowley KM, Clubb KS, Smith GJ, Cabin HS.

We studied 142 consecutively autopsied patients prospectively to determine the
frequency and clinical importance of right-sided endocardial lesions in patients 
who had undergone flow-directed pulmonary-artery catheterization within one month
of death. Of the 55 catheterized patients, 29 (53 per cent) had one or more
right-sided endocardial lesions: 12 (22 per cent) had subendocardial hemorrhage, 
11 (20 per cent) sterile thrombus, 2 (4 per cent) hemorrhage and thrombus, and 4 
(7 per cent) infective endocarditis. Of 41 lesions seen in the 29 patients, 23
(56 per cent) were located on the pulmonic valve, 6 (15 per cent) on the
tricuspid valve, 6 (15 per cent) in the right atrium, 4 (10 per cent) in the
right ventricle, and 2 (5 per cent) in the main pulmonary artery. All four
patients with infective endocarditis had had positive antemortem blood cultures
while the catheter was in place, but in only one had the diagnosis of
endocarditis been suspected clinically. The unusual locations of the infected
vegetations (on the pulmonic valve in three and in the right atrium in one) and
the similar location of the uninfected lesions suggest that the infective
endocarditis was a consequence of catheter-induced endocardial damage with
concurrent or subsequent bacteremia. Among the 87 non-catheterized patients,
there were two subendocardial hemorrhages and one resolving right atrial
thrombus. We conclude that endocardial damage from flow-directed pulmonary-artery
catheterization is common and that right-sided infective endocarditis should be
suspected in bacteremic catheterized patients.

Deficiency of enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of glycerol-ether lipids in
Zellweger syndrome. A new category of metabolic disease involving the absence of 
peroxisomes.

Datta NS, Wilson GN, Hajra AK.

The Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by
the absence of peroxisomes and deficiency of glycerol-ether lipids in several
tissues. We measured the activity of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)
acyltransferase, a peroxisomal enzyme with a major role in ether lipid synthesis,
in fibroblasts and leukocytes from patients with Zellweger syndrome. Control skin
and amniotic-fluid fibroblasts had normal activity of DHAP acyltransferase (0.28 
to 0.3 nmol per minute per milligram of protein), whereas fibroblasts from three 
patients with Zellweger syndrome had deficient activity (0.013 +/- 0.006 nmol per
minute per milligram of protein). The activity of the enzyme in leukocytes and
levels of plasmalogens (the major class of cellular glycerol-ether lipids) in
erythrocytes were also deficient in a patient, but normal levels of leukocyte
enzyme and erythrocyte plasmalogens were found in her parents. Other enzymes of
the acyl DHAP pathway exhibited alterations in fibroblasts from patients with
Zellweger syndrome, and the activity of the glycerophosphate acyltransferase was 
also reduced. These results support prior studies emphasizing the role of
peroxisomes and the acyl DHAP pathway in cellular ether lipid synthesis,
establish Zellweger syndrome cells as valuable for elucidating peroxisomal
functions, and provide prenatal and postnatal diagnostic assays as well as
potential therapeutic strategies for Zellweger syndrome.

Inherited chondrodysplasia punctata due to a deletion of the terminal short arm
of an X chromosome.

Curry CJ, Magenis RE, Brown M, Lanman JT Jr, Tsai J, O'Lague P, Goodfellow P,
Mohandas T, Bergner EA, Shapiro LJ.

We studied two families with an inherited deletion of the short arm of an X
chromosome (Xp) in which affected male offspring have epiphyseal stippling in
infancy (chondrodysplasia punctata), nasal hypoplasia, ichthyosis, and mental
retardation. The presence of ichthyosis and the apparent pattern of X-linked
recessive inheritance prompted investigation of the short arm of the X chromosome
through studies of genetic markers and focused cytogenetic analysis. Biochemical 
studies suggested that there was a deletion of three genes previously mapped to
the X-chromosome short arm, including the steroid sulfatase locus, the Xg locus, 
and the M1C2X locus. Prometaphase chromosomes demonstrated a deletion of Xp at
p22.32 in the affected boys, in their obligate-carrier mothers, and in 11 of 25
women at risk as potential carriers. The women carrying the Xp deletion had
normal gonadal function and fertility but were shorter than the noncarriers in
their families (P less than 0.00001). These findings have implications for the
genetic organization of this portion of the human X chromosome and demonstrate
that small cytogenetic abnormalities may account for disorders with apparent
mendelian patterns of inheritance.

Sinus arrest during REM sleep in young adults.

Guilleminault C, Pool P, Motta J, Gillis AM.

Four apparently healthy young adults with vague chest symptoms during the day,
two of whom had infrequent syncope while ambulatory at night, had periods of
asystole up to nine seconds in duration occurring repeatedly during
rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Extensive evaluations, including
electrophysiologic studies in two patients, were normal. It is therefore
suggested that the underlying pathophysiology involved autonomic dysfunction. REM
sleep-related sinus arrests such as these, which may occur in apparently healthy 
subjects but are undetected, may explain some cases of sudden, unexpected death
during sleep. Polygraphic monitoring during sleep may be helpful in delineating
the pathophysiology of the sleep-related arrhythmia in persons with daytime
cardiac arrhythmias thought to be secondary to abnormal vagal tone. The
possibility of nocturnal asystole should be considered in patients such as those 
described here.

Hereditary adult-onset leukodystrophy simulating chronic progressive multiple
sclerosis.

Eldridge R, Anayiotos CP, Schlesinger S, Cowen D, Bever C, Patronas N, McFarland 
H.

We studied a large kindred with a chronic progressive neurologic disorder
affecting at least 10 men and 11 women in four generations in a pattern
compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. In 20 of the affected subjects,
evaluated before the availability of computerized tomography and without regard
to family history, the diagnosis was multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of the
neurologic disorder begin in the fourth and fifth decades and include cerebellar,
pyramidal, and autonomic abnormalities. The autonomic symptoms, which involve
bowel and bladder regulation and orthostatic hypotension, may be the earliest
changes but are frequently disregarded. Survival for 20 years after onset is
common. The CT scan is striking and shows a symmetrical decrease in white-matter 
density, beginning in the frontal lobes but extending to all of the centrum ovale
and the cerebellar white matter. Limited pathological observation reveals gross
white-matter degeneration with microscopic vacuolation, preservation of U fibers 
and cortical structures, and no inflammatory changes or reactive gliosis. Because
of its hereditary basis, the disorder should be susceptible to genetic definition
and ultimately to treatment or prevention.

Complement activation and hypersensitivity reactions to dialysis membranes.

Hakim RM, Breillatt J, Lazarus JM, Port FK.

Certain patients receiving hemodialysis experience recurrent chest pain, dyspnea,
and hypotension during exposure to new cuprophane-membrane dialyzers (the
"first-use syndrome"). Because activation of complement may be involved in these 
events, we examined in vivo complement activation with new cuprophane membranes
and in vitro activation by zymosan in 6 such patients, and compared them with 10 
patients who did not have symptoms during dialysis. All patients with the
first-use syndrome had maximal complement activation 10 minutes after initiation 
of dialysis, with C3a des-arginine (desArg), the stable metabolite of C3
activation, equal to 8533 +/- 157 ng per milliliter (mean +/- S.E.M.). In
asymptomatic patients the maximal C3a desArg value occurred at 15 minutes and was
only 2907 +/- 372 ng per milliliter (P less than or equal to 0.0001). At a
concentration of 3.8 x 10(-5) g of zymosan per milliliter, patients with the
first-use syndrome had a C3a desArg level of 29.6 +/- 1.4 micrograms per
milliliter, whereas it was only 16.6 +/- 2.3 micrograms per milliliter in
asymptomatic patients (P less than or equal to 0.0001). Two other patients, who
experienced cardiopulmonary collapse during the first two minutes of dialysis,
had a C3a desArg level of 18,900 and 7800 ng per milliliter, respectively. We
conclude that the occurrence of adverse symptoms associated with new
cuprophane-membrane dialyzers correlates with complement activation.

Positive direct antiglobulin tests and immune hemolytic anemia in patients
receiving procainamide.

Kleinman S, Nelson R, Smith L, Goldfinger D.

To characterize the autoimmune phenomena in patients receiving procainamide, we
studied the prevalence of positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs') tests and immune
hemolytic anemia in 100 such patients and compared them with 100 age-matched and 
sex-matched controls. There was a significant increase in the frequency of
positive direct antiglobulin tests in patients receiving procainamide (21 vs. 10 
per cent, P = 0.05). The mechanism of red-cell sensitization in patients
receiving procainamide was the production of red-cell autoantibody, which was
serologically indistinguishable from that seen in warm autoimmune hemolytic
anemia. In contrast, positive direct antiglobulin tests in control patients were 
due to the presence of complement components. Red-cell autoantibody production
secondary to procainamide was not correlated with a higher-than-expected
frequency of antinuclear antibodies or the clinical syndrome of drug-induced
lupus erythematosus. In the series of 100 patients receiving procainamide, we
identified three cases of immune hemolytic anemia. In two of the three cases, the
anemia resolved after the medication was discontinued and did not require steroid
therapy. We conclude that procainamide often results in the production of
red-cell autoimmune phenomena.

Familial hyperproinsulinemia due to a proposed defect in conversion of proinsulin
to insulin.

Gruppuso PA, Gorden P, Kahn CR, Cornblath M, Zeller WP, Schwartz R.

Familial hyperproinsulinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated
plasma levels of proinsulin-like material. In two previously described kindreds
this has been shown to be due to a structural abnormality in the proinsulin
molecule. We have identified a third family with hyperproinsulinemia in which
there appeared to be a different defect. The propositus, a 12-year-old girl, had 
borderline glucose intolerance and markedly elevated immunoreactive-insulin
levels on oral glucose-tolerance testing. Gel filtration of plasma revealed that 
66 per cent of circulating insulin immunoreactivity was accounted for by the
proinsulin-like components. Two of four siblings, the father, and the paternal
grandfather also had elevated fasting insulin immunoreactivity in the presence of
normal plasma glucose concentrations and elevated levels of proinsulin-like
material. In vitro tryptic digestion of plasma proinsulin-like material from an
affected family member revealed that proinsulin was converted to insulin in a
manner indistinguishable from that in the control. Similarly, proinsulin and
insulin exhibited normal activity in a radioreceptor assay. These findings
suggest that the proinsulin molecule in this family was normal and that
hyperproinsulinemia was due to a defect in the conversion of proinsulin to
insulin.

Progressive neurologic deterioration and renal failure due to storage of glutamyl
ribose-5-phosphate.

Williams JC, Butler IJ, Rosenberg HS, Verani R, Scott CI, Conley SB.

A six-year-old boy presented with a history of seizures, progressive neurologic
deterioration, and proteinuria. Physical examination revealed mildly coarse
facies, failure to thrive, generalized hypotonia with muscle wasting, and optic
atrophy; there was no organomegaly. The family history suggested an X-linked
recessive inheritance. The electroencephalogram, electroretinogram, evoked
potentials, and computed axial tomography of the brain were abnormal. Urine
oligosaccharide chromatography, urine amino acids and organic acids, and results 
of leukocyte and fibroblast lysosomal-enzyme assays for the known storage
diseases were normal; however, conjunctival and renal biopsy specimens contained 
enlarged lysosomes on electron microscopy. The patient had progressive neurologic
deterioration and died of renal failure at eight years of age. A compound
identified as glutamyl ribose-5-phosphate was purified from the brain (0.96 mumol
per gram, wet weight) and kidney (0.60 mumol per gram, wet weight). This compound
is the linkage group in ADP-ribosylation of proteins, an important regulatory
process in gene expression and DNA repair. We believe this new disorder
represents a glycoproteinosis that results in the cytoplasmic storage of glutamyl
ribose-5-phosphate.

Bone-marrow transplantation in severe Gaucher's disease.

Rappeport JM, Ginns EI.

We performed allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation of normal cells in an
eight-year-old patient with Type 3 Gaucher's disease in an attempt to alter his
progressive deterioration. The procedure resulted in complete engraftment of the 
enzymatically normal donor cells. Donor monocyte precursors were present in the
circulation of the recipient by 28 days after transplantation.
Post-transplantation beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in mononuclear white cells 
in peripheral blood exceeded normal levels. Despite these early results no change
in Gaucher's-cell infiltration of the bone marrow was noted for at least 111
days, and Gaucher's cells persisted in the marrow for at least 274 days. The
plasma glucocerebroside concentration ultimately returned to normal. During the
post-transplantation course, until the patient died from an episode of sepsis,
there was no important change in his clinical status. However, this case
demonstrates that the enzymatic abnormality in hematopoietic cells in Gaucher's
disease is correctable by bone-marrow transplantation, leading to normalization
of plasma levels of glucocerebroside. We observed the long survival of Gaucher's 
cells, which was consistent with the lack of clinical improvement. Intervention
might have been more effective earlier in the course of the disease.

Biclonal B-cell lymphoma.

Sklar J, Cleary ML, Thielemans K, Gralow J, Warnke R, Levy R.

The cells of most tumors are considered to be genetically homogeneous because
they are assumed to represent a single clone descended from one abnormal cell. We
have discovered three cases of B-cell lymphoma for which this generalization is
not true. In each case, the tumor was composed of two subpopulations of cells,
each expressing a different immunoglobulin molecule. Antibodies directed against 
these immunoglobulins were used to separate the two cell subpopulations of each
tumor on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. DNA extracted from the original
tumor and the two fractionated subpopulations was analyzed to determine the
configuration of immunoglobulin genes. Differences were found in the arrangement 
of DNA in at least one immunoglobulin gene for each of the two subpopulations.
Thus, biclonality of these tumors was revealed by examination of both protein
markers (cell-surface immunoglobulin) and DNA markers (immunoglobulin-gene
rearrangements). Our results indicate that the incidence of biclonal B-cell
lymphoma may be higher than previously recognized, possibly as high as 10 per
cent of all B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, our findings may have important
implications for the diagnosis and therapy of lymphoid cancers.

Ectopic secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor as a cause of Cushing's
syndrome. A clinical, morphologic, and biochemical study.

Carey RM, Varma SK, Drake CR Jr, Thorner MO, Kovacs K, Rivier J, Vale W.

Corticotropin-releasing factor, a hypophyseo-tropic hormone that stimulates
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion, has recently been isolated,
characterized, and synthesized in the sheep and rat. We report on a patient with 
metastatic carcinoma of the prostate presenting with anterior and posterior
pituitary hormone deficiency together with ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. At 
postmortem examination, large areas of the median eminence and pituitary stalk
were replaced by tumor, but the corticotrophs were markedly hyperplastic.
Immunostaining of tumor cells was positive for corticotropin-releasing factor and
was negative for ACTH and a wide range of other hormones. Radioimmunoassay and
bioassays showed that tumor extracts and further purified fractions were active
in corticotropin-releasing factor, and the tumor material coeluted with
corticotropin-releasing factor on high-pressure liquid chromatography. These
studies demonstrate that ectopic secretion of corticotropin-releasing factor is a
cause of Cushing's syndrome in human beings. The features of this syndrome
include hypercortisolism, pituitary corticotroph hyperplasia, elevation of
circulating ACTH levels, and failure to suppress the pituitary-adrenal axis with 
exogenous glucocorticoids.

Circulating heparan sulfate anticoagulant in a patient with a fatal bleeding
disorder.

Palmer RN, Rick ME, Rick PD, Zeller JA, Gralnick HR.

We have identified a circulating, heparin-like anticoagulant in a patient with
multiple myeloma (IgG4 lambda) who had serious clinically evident bleeding that
contributed to his death. Purification of the patient's circulating coagulation
inhibitor was accomplished by ammonium sulfate concentration, anion exchange
chromatography, and affinity chromatography on protamine sulfate. Analysis of the
purified inhibitor showed that it was a proteoglycan that comigrated with heparan
sulfate on lithium acetate-agarose-gel electrophoresis and that it contained 39
per cent L-iduronic acid. Control samples of heparan sulfate and heparin
contained 29 and 68 per cent L-iduronic acid, respectively. Functional
coagulation studies revealed that the purified inhibitor had cofactor activity
with antithrombin III that could be abolished by prior incubation with protamine 
sulfate or platelet factor 4. Recognition of the existence of this or of other
similar inhibitors in bleeding patients is important because of the potential for
treatment with agents such as protamine sulfate and platelet factor 4, which
neutralize the anticoagulant effects of proteoglycans.

Episodic angioedema associated with eosinophilia.

Gleich GJ, Schroeter AL, Marcoux JP, Sachs MI, O'Connell EJ, Kohler PF.

We studied four patients with recurrent attacks of angioedema, urticaria, and
fever. During attacks, body weights increased up to 18 per cent, and leukocyte
counts reached 108,000 per microliter (88 per cent eosinophils). The disease did 
not appear to threaten the function of vital organs. The two children received
prednisone intermittently; the adults did not require treatment or were given
alternate-day prednisone. Glucocorticoid therapy caused defervescence and
diuresis and decreased total leukocyte and eosinophil counts. No patient had
evidence of cardiac involvement (follow-up, 2 to 17 years). One patient remained 
in spontaneous remission for 20 years before symptoms recurred. Histologic
studies showed that eosinophils localized and degranulated in the dermis, and
they appeared to induce edema. Although this syndrome might be classified as a
variant of the hypereosinophilic syndrome, we believe it is a separate entity
because of its distinctive characteristics and its benign course.

Inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis by the anesthetic etomidate.

Wagner RL, White PF, Kan PB, Rosenthal MH, Feldman D.

The use of the intravenous anesthetic etomidate for prolonged sedation has been
associated with low levels of plasma cortisol and increased mortality. We
measured the cortisol and aldosterone responses to ACTH stimulation in five
patients receiving etomidate, and we also studied the direct effects of etomidate
on enzymes in the rat steroidogenic pathway. One patient who was receiving a
20-hour infusion of etomidate (1.3 to 1.5 mg per kilogram of body weight per
hour) had marked adrenocortical suppression that was still evident four days
after etomidate was discontinued. Four surgical patients receiving etomidate
during their operations were all found to have adrenal suppression four hours
after the operation; mean (+/- S.D.) increases in cortisol and aldosterone after 
ACTH stimulation were only 1.8 +/- 0.5 micrograms per deciliter and 0.5 +/- 1.1
ng per deciliter, respectively. In rat adrenal cells, etomidate produced a
concentration-dependent blockade of the two mitochondrial cytochrome
P-450-dependent enzymes, cholesterol-side-chain cleavage enzyme, and 11
beta-hydroxylase, without evident inhibition of the microsomal enzymes in the
glucocorticoid pathway. Physicians should be aware that etomidate inhibits
adrenal steroidogenesis, and they should consider treating selected patients with
corticosteroids if etomidate is used.

Familial hyperinsulinemia due to a structurally abnormal insulin. Definition of
an emerging new clinical syndrome.

Haneda M, Polonsky KS, Bergenstal RM, Jaspan JB, Shoelson SE, Blix PM, Chan SJ,
Kwok SC, Wishner WB, Zeidler A, et al.

We have identified a patient with mild diabetes, marked fasting hyperinsulinemia 
(89 to 130 microU of insulin per milliliter), and a reduced fasting C-peptide:
insulin molar ratio of 1.11 to 1.50 (normal, greater than 4). The patient
responded normally to exogenous insulin. However, her endogenous immunoreactive
insulin showed reduced biologic activity during a glucose-clamp study with
hyperglycemia and a reduced ability to bind to the insulin receptor and stimulate
glucose transport in vitro. Family studies showed that five additional relatives 
in three generations had variable degrees of glucose intolerance, marked
hyperinsulinemia, and a reduced peripheral C-peptide:insulin molar ratio.
Restriction-endonuclease cleavage of DNA isolated from circulating leukocytes in 
the patient and in family members with hyperinsulinemia revealed loss of the
MboII recognition site in one allele of the insulin gene--consistent with a point
mutation at position 24 or 25 in the insulin B chain. Other studies using
high-pressure liquid chromatography and detailed gene analysis have identified
the defect as a serine for phenylalanine substitution at position 24 of the
insulin B chain. The secretion of a structurally abnormal insulin should be
considered in patients with hyperinsulinemia who respond normally to exogenous
insulin and have a reduced C-peptide:insulin molar ratio. Glucose tolerance may
range from relatively normal to overtly diabetic.

Aluminum intoxication from aluminum-containing phosphate binders in children with
azotemia not undergoing dialysis.

Andreoli SP, Bergstein JM, Sherrard DJ.

Aluminum intoxication developed in three infants with azotemia who were not
undergoing dialysis and who had been treated with aluminum hydroxide from the
first month of life. Biopsies of the iliac crest demonstrated the presence of
severe osteomalacia and massive deposition of aluminum in the bone. Serum
aluminum levels were significantly (P less than 0.001) higher in these 3 infants 
and in 1 other, all of whom received more than 100 mg of elemental aluminum per
kilogram of body weight per day (mean +/- S.D., 371.0 +/- 178.9 ng per milliliter
[13.75 +/- 6.6 mumol per liter] ) than they were in 8 older children with
azotemia who were not undergoing dialysis and who received less than 100 mg of
elemental aluminum per kilogram per day (27.0 +/- 18.6 ng per milliliter [1.0 +/-
0.68 mumol per liter] ), 7 such children who did not receive aluminum hydroxide
(20.28 +/- 9.2 ng per milliliter [0.75 +/- 0.34 mumol per liter] ), and 16
children with normal renal function (21.04 +/- 4.9 ng per milliliter [0.78 +/-
0.18 mumol per liter] ). In all the children with azotemia who were treated with 
aluminum hydroxide, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.90; P less than 0.01)
between the serum aluminum level and the daily dose of elemental aluminum. These 
studies indicate that gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum can lead to
aluminum intoxication in children with azotemia, and that infants may be
particularly susceptible to this complication of therapy.

Homocystinuria and megaloblastic anemia responsive to vitamin B12 therapy. An
inborn error of metabolism due to a defect in cobalamin metabolism.

Schuh S, Rosenblatt DS, Cooper BA, Schroeder ML, Bishop AJ, Seargeant LE, Haworth
JC.

We describe an inborn error of vitamin B12 metabolism in an infant who had severe
developmental delay, megaloblastic anemia, and homocystinuria. There was no
evidence of methylmalonic aciduria or deficiency of folate or vitamin B12.
Treatment with hydroxocobalamin, but not with cyanocobalamin and folic acid,
resulted in rapid clinical and biochemical improvement. Cultured fibroblasts
showed an absolute growth requirement for methionine, defective incorporation of 
radioactivity from [14C]5-methyltetrahydrofolate into protein, and normal
incorporation of radioactivity from [14C]propionate, thus assigning the
intracellular defect to methionine synthesis. The proportion of intracellular
methylcobalamin in the fibroblasts was decreased, but that of
5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin was normal. Methionine synthetase activity in cell
extracts was normal, as was cobalamin incorporation into cultured cells. This
defect differs from those described previously in being limited to
methylcobalamin accumulation and defective use of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by
intact cells with normal activity of methylmalonyl CoA mutase.

Associated focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis in the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome.

Rao TK, Filippone EJ, Nicastri AD, Landesman SH, Frank E, Chen CK, Friedman EA.

Of the 92 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were
seen at our institution over a two-year period, 9 acquired the nephrotic syndrome
(urinary protein greater than 3.5 g per 24 hours) and 2 had azotemia with lesser 
amounts of urinary protein. Five of these 11 patients had a history of
intravenous-heroin addiction, but in the remaining six, there were no known
predisposing factors for nephropathy. In nine patients (including the six
non-addicts) the course of renal disease was marked by rapid progression to
severe uremia. Renal tissue examined by biopsy in seven patients and at autopsy
in three revealed focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis with intraglomerular
deposition of IgM and C3. In the 11th patient, renal biopsy revealed an increase 
in mesangial matrix and cells, with deposition of IgG and C3 consistent with a
mild immune-complex glomerulonephritis, and severe interstitial nephritis. We
conclude that focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis may be associated with AIDS 
and suggest that rapid deterioration to uremia may characterize this renal
disease.

Homozygous protein C deficiency manifested by massive venous thrombosis in the
newborn.

Seligsohn U, Berger A, Abend M, Rubin L, Attias D, Zivelin A, Rapaport SI.

We studied a family in which two infants had died with massive venous thrombosis 
shortly after birth. Protein C antigen was undetectable by immunologic assays of 
plasma available from one infant. (Protein C is a potent naturally occurring
anticoagulant that inactivates activated coagulation factors V and VIII). The
parents, who were first cousins, both had partial protein C deficiency. Reduced
protein C levels were also observed in 12 of 25 additional family members. None
of the partially deficient family members (age range 4 to 70 years) had
thrombotic episodes. Our data support the view that hereditary protein C
deficiency is an autosomal disorder in which the homozygous state may be
manifested by the virtual absence of plasma protein C and by fatal thrombosis in 
the neonatal period.

Treatment of congenital osteopetrosis with high-dose calcitriol.

Key L, Carnes D, Cole S, Holtrop M, Bar-Shavit Z, Shapiro F, Arceci R, Steinberg 
J, Gundberg C, Kahn A, et al.

We administered high doses of calcitriol (up to 32 micrograms per day) to an
infant with malignant osteopetrosis, in an attempt to stimulate bone resorption. 
The patient was placed on a low-calcium diet to prevent hypercalcemia. Measures
of bone turnover increased during calcitriol therapy; hydroxyproline excretion
rose from 140 to 1358 micrograms per milligram of creatinine per 24 hours, with
parallel increases in the ratio of calcium to creatinine in the urine, urinary
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, serum osteocalcin, and serum alkaline phosphatase. A 
pretreatment bone-biopsy specimen contained no osteoclasts with ruffled borders, 
a feature of active osteoclasts. After 11 days of calcitriol, ruffled borders
were noted. After three months, numerous osteoclasts with ruffled borders and
associated bony disruption were evident. Before therapy, the patient's monocytes 
were incapable of in vitro bone resorption, but after calcitriol, their
resorptive capacity was increased to 3.3 times control levels. These data
demonstrate that calcitriol increased bone mineral and matrix turnover in our
patient. However, during the three months of calcitriol therapy there was only
slight clinical improvement in her severe disease. Early and sustained treatment 
with calcitriol may be useful in osteopetrosis.

Clinical use of the total artificial heart.

DeVries WC, Anderson JL, Joyce LD, Anderson FL, Hammond EH, Jarvik RK, Kolff WJ.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 2004 Feb 5;350(6):542-4.

We report here our first experience with the use of a total artificial heart in a
human being. The heart was developed at the University of Utah, and the patient
was a 61-year-old man with chronic congestive heart failure due to primary
cardiomyopathy, who also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Except for
dysfunction of the prosthetic mitral valve, which required replacement of the
left-heart prosthesis on the 13th postoperative day, the artificial heart
functioned well for the entire postoperative course of 112 days. The mean blood
pressure was 84 +/- 8 mm Hg, and cardiac output was generally maintained at 6.7
+/- 0.8 liters per minute for the right heart and 7.5 +/- 0.8 for the left,
resulting in postoperative diuresis and relief of congestive failure. The
postoperative course was complicated by recurrent pulmonary insufficiency,
several episodes of acute renal failure, episodes of fever of unidentified cause 
(necessitating multiple courses of antibiotics), hemorrhagic complications of
anticoagulation, and one generalized seizure of uncertain cause. On the 92nd
postoperative day, the patient had diarrhea and vomiting, leading to aspiration
pneumonia and sepsis. Death occurred on the 112th day, preceded by progressive
renal failure and refractory hypotension, despite maintenance of cardiac output. 
Autopsy revealed extensive pseudomembranous colitis, acute tubular necrosis,
peritoneal and pleural effusion, centrilobular emphysema, and chronic bronchitis 
with fibrosis and bronchiectasis. The artificial heart system was intact and
uninvolved by thrombosis or infectious processes. This experience should
encourage further clinical trials with the artificial heart, but we emphasize
that the procedure is still highly experimental. Further experience, development,
and discussion will be required before more general application of the device can
be recommended.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) associated with transfusions.

Curran JW, Lawrence DN, Jaffe H, Kaplan JE, Zyla LD, Chamberland M, Weinstein R, 
Lui KJ, Schonberger LB, Spira TJ, et al.

Of 2157 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) whose cases
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control by August 22, 1983, 64 (3 per
cent) with AIDS and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had no recognized risk factors
for AIDS. Eighteen of these (28 per cent) had received blood components within
five years before the onset of illness. These patients with
transfusion-associated AIDS were more likely to be white (P = 0.00008) and older 
(P = 0.0013) than other patients with no known risk factors. They had received
blood 15 to 57 months (median, 27.5) before the diagnosis of AIDS, from 2 to 48
donors (median, 14). At least one high-risk donor was identified by interview or 
T-cell-subset analysis in each of the seven cases in which investigation of the
donors was complete; five of the six high-risk donors identified during interview
also had low T-cell helper/suppressor ratios, and four had generalized
lymphadenopathy according to history or examination. These findings strengthen
the evidence that AIDS may be transmitted in blood.

Remission of essential hypertension after renal transplantation.

Curtis JJ, Luke RG, Dustan HP, Kashgarian M, Whelchel JD, Jones P, Diethelm AG.

Six patients in whom "essential hypertension" led to nephrosclerosis and kidney
failure received kidney transplants from normotensive donors. After an average
follow-up of 4.5 years, all were normotensive and had evidence of reversal of
hypertensive damage to the heart and retinal vessels. These six patients, all of 
whom were black, and six control subjects matched for age, sex, and race were
admitted to the General Clinical Research Center for 11 days for observation of
their blood pressure and their responses to salt deprivation and salt loading.
Mean arterial pressure (+/- S.E.M.) among the patients who had previously had
essential hypertension was similar to that of the normal controls (92 +/- 1.9 vs.
94 +/- 3.9; P not significant), and both groups had similar responses to salt
deprivation and salt loading. Thus, essential hypertension in human beings is
shown to be similar to the hypertension seen in spontaneously hypertensive rats
in that both can be corrected by transplantation of a kidney from a normotensive 
donor. This observation supports the concept of the primary of the kidney in
causing essential hypertension.

Hypoparathyroidism in Wilson's disease.

Carpenter TO, Carnes DL Jr, Anast CS.

An 11-year-old girl with Wilson's disease presented with mild hypocalcemia (8.0
mg per deciliter), hypophosphatemia (2.7 mg per deciliter), hypercalciuria (569
mg per day), and hyperphosphaturia (tubular reabsorption of phosphate, 67 per
cent). The hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria were attributed to the Fanconi
syndrome, a known component of Wilson's disease. Circulating immunoreactive
parathyroid hormone was usually undetectable or, occasionally, detectable at
minimal levels in the presence of depressed blood levels of ionized calcium.
Normal levels of ionized calcium were not maintained throughout a 24-hour
monitoring period. The patient had tetany during a period of rapid reduction in
ionized calcium levels, and an appropriate rise in circulating immunoreactive
parathyroid levels was never demonstrated. Induced hypocalcemia during citrate
infusion did not stimulate parathyroid secretion, nor did infusion of magnesium. 
We conclude that parathyroid insufficiency may be associated with Wilson's
disease. We speculate that it is due to deposition of copper in the parathyroid
glands.

Chronic fructose intoxication after infancy in children with hereditary fructose 
intolerance. A cause of growth retardation.

Mock DM, Perman JA, Thaler M, Morris RC Jr.

In two unrelated boys, 5.3 and 3.8 years of age with hereditary fructose
intolerance, apparently isolated growth retardation (-2.71 S.D. and -2.40 S.D.)
occurred after infancy, even though acute symptomatic fructose intoxication was
prevented by restriction of dietary fructose. When more stringent restriction of 
dietary fructose was instituted (approximately 40 mg per kilogram of body weight 
per day), growth velocity increased from the 25th to the 97th percentile in one
child and from well below the 3d to above the 75th percentile in the other. When 
restriction of dietary fructose was experimentally relaxed (from 10 to 250 mg per
kilogram per day), neither boy had symptoms, hypoglycemia, or evidence of hepatic
or renal dysfunction, but both had sustained hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria
and increases in the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of magnesium. We 
conclude that in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, clinically
important chronic fructose intoxication can occur after infancy without causing
symptoms of acute fructose intoxication and can be expressed as an apparently
isolated, reversible retardation of somatic growth with a continuing disorder of 
adenine nucleotide metabolism, characterized in part by recurrently increased
rates of degradation of adenine nucleotides.

Central-nervous-system lymphoma related to Epstein-Barr virus.

Hochberg FH, Miller G, Schooley RT, Hirsch MS, Feorino P, Henle W.

We have studied five cases suggesting a relation between Epstein-Barr virus
infection and primary lymphoma of the central nervous system. A 48-year-old man
had primary lymphoma of the central nervous system in the absence of systemic
lymphoma or immunosuppression. Development of the tumor was associated with
serologic evidence suggesting a recent primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus.
DNA preparations from tumor tissue, but not from adjacent normal brain tissue,
contained Epstein-Barr virus genomes when hybridized with a probe consisting of
the BamHI K fragment of Epstein-Barr virus strain FF41. Evaluation of serum
samples from four additional patients with central-nervous-system lymphoma
revealed patterns of Epstein-Barr virus-specific antibody that were suggestive of
an ongoing infection with EBV. Our results suggest induction of the lymphoma by
Epstein-Barr virus.

Mutation of antitrypsin to antithrombin. alpha 1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh (358 Met 
leads to Arg), a fatal bleeding disorder.

Owen MC, Brennan SO, Lewis JH, Carrell RW.

Our previous studies predicted a functional relationship between the plasma
proteins alpha 1-antitrypsin and antithrombin III. To elucidate this relationship
we investigated the plasma of a 14-year-old boy who had died from an episodic
bleeding disorder. A variant alpha 1-antitrypsin was identified in which the
methionine at position 358 had been replaced by an arginine. This had converted
the alpha 1-antitrypsin from its normal function as an inhibitor of elastase to
that of an inhibitor of thrombin. This finding indicates that the reactive center
of alpha 1-antitrypsin is methionine 358, which acts as a bait for elastase, just
as the normal reactive center of antithrombin III is arginine 393, which acts as 
a bait for thrombin. The independence of the new thrombin inhibitor from heparin 
control explains the bleeding disorder; it also indicates that heparin normally
acts directly on antithrombin III, revealing its inherent inhibitory activity.
The episodic nature of the bleeding was a consequence of the mutant protein's
being an acute-phase reactant, the level of which increased several-fold after
trauma.

Chromosomal translocation involving the immunoglobulin kappa-chain and
heavy-chain loci in a child with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Sonnier JA, Buchanan GR, Howard-Peebles PN, Rutledge J, Smith RG.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is usually a monoclonal B-cell neoplasm that occurs 
almost exclusively in middle-aged and elderly adults. We observed a rapidly
progressive case of the disease in a 10-year-old girl. The leukemic cells bore
surface IgM and IgD immunoglobulins of the kappa-light-chain type. Karyotyping of
the abnormal cells revealed an unusual translocation [t(2;14) (p13;q32)], with
break points at or near the kappa-light-chain and heavy-chain gene loci.
Translocations involving the immunoglobulin gene loci may be important in the
pathogenesis of some cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as they appear to be 
in Burkitt's lymphoma.

Acid-labile alpha interferon. A possible preclinical marker for the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome in hemophilia.

Eyster ME, Goedert JJ, Poon MC, Preble OT.

Many homosexual men with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have an
unusual acid-labile form of human leukocyte, or alpha, interferon in their serum.
Male patients with classic hemophilia treated with lyophilized clotting-factor
concentrates are also at high risk for the development of AIDS. To determine
whether the level of alpha interferon may be a preclinical marker of early
subclinical disease, we examined stored plasma and serum from three hemophilic
patients with AIDS. Persistently elevated levels of the acid-labile form of alpha
interferon were found in all three patients. In two patients the appearance of
circulating alpha interferon preceded the onset of clinical disease by 3 to 10
months. In contrast, alpha-interferon levels were not elevated in 43 of 46
unselected patients with hemophilia; three of these patients had transient
elevations. These results suggest that acid-labile alpha interferon may be a
marker that can be used to identify affected asymptomatic members of high-risk
groups before the onset of clinical disease.

Sensory neuropathy from pyridoxine abuse. A new megavitamin syndrome.

Schaumburg H, Kaplan J, Windebank A, Vick N, Rasmus S, Pleasure D, Brown MJ.

We describe seven adults who had ataxia and severe sensory-nervous-system
dysfunction after daily high-level pyridoxine (vitamin B6) consumption. Four were
severely disabled; all improved after withdrawal. Weakness was not a feature of
this condition, and the central nervous system was clinically spared. Although
consumption of large doses of pyridoxine has gained wide public acceptance, this 
report indicates that it can cause sensory neuropathy or neuronopathy syndromes
and that safe guidelines should be established for the use of this widely abused 
vitamin.

Hemorrhagic proctitis due to lymphogranuloma venereum serogroup L2. Diagnosis by 
fluorescent monoclonal antibody.

Klotz SA, Drutz DJ, Tam MR, Reed KH.

Definitive diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum is impeded by difficulty in
culturing the causative agent and by serologic cross-reactivity between Chlamydia
trachomatis L1, L2, and L3, which can cause the disease, and the many other
serotypes of C. trachomatis, which do not. In a 23-year-old man with massive
rectal bleeding, an exudative rectal ulcer, and inguinal lymphadenopathy,
serologic findings were compatible with a recent lymphogranuloma venereum
infection, but stains and cultures of lymph-node aspirates were negative, and
biopsy specimens of the rectum and lymph nodes showed only nonspecific
inflammatory changes. A diagnosis of lymphogranuloma venereum was made when
intracellular organisms and inclusion bodies were demonstrated in rectal
submucosal tissue by fluorescein-tagged monoclonal antibodies directed against
both chlamydial group antigens and L2 serotype antigen. This technique was of
particular value in this patient because it specifically identified an unusual
cause of severe gastrointestinal bleeding.

Molecular heterogeneity of inherited antithrombin III deficiency.

Prochownik EV, Antonarakis S, Bauer KA, Rosenberg RD, Fearon ER, Orkin SH.

Inherited antithrombin III deficiency is associated with an increased risk of
thromboembolism. Using recombinant-DNA techniques, we isolated a molecular probe 
for the antithrombin III structural gene and identified a common DNA polymorphism
within the gene. We found that there is genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.
In one family, the antithrombin III gene was deleted in affected members, whereas
in another no deletion occurred. Use of the DNA polymorphism should allow
identification and further characterization of abnormal antithrombin III genes.

Detection of leukemia-related karyotypes in granulocyte/macrophage colonies from 
a patient with acute myelomonocytic leukemia.

Reid MM, Tantravahi R, Grier HE, O'Toole S, Miller BA, Lipton JM, Weinstein HJ,
Nathan DG.

We performed cytogenetic analysis of 11 normal-appearing granulocyte/macrophage
colonies derived from cultures of the marrow of a child with acute myelomonocytic
leukemia in relapse. We found diploid karyotypes and two abnormal ones--both
hyperdiploid and containing the translocation t(1q-;11q+). A clonal origin of the
karyotypic differences was suggested by the absence of variation within
individual colonies. The evidence suggests that in this patient, the cytogenetic 
abnormality originated at or before the stage of granulocyte/macrophage
progenitor.

Human cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent and immunodeficient persons. Studies
of an outbreak and experimental transmission.

Current WL, Reese NC, Ernst JV, Bailey WS, Heyman MB, Weinstein WM.

Infection with cryptosporidium occurred in 12 immunocompetent persons who had
direct contact with the feces of infected calves during three unrelated outbreaks
of calf cryptosporidiosis. Nine of the twelve subjects had diarrhea and abdominal
cramps that lasted 1 to 10 days. Infections were diagnosed and monitored by
detection of oocysts in feces, with a modified Sheather's flotation technique and
phase-contrast microscopy. Oocysts of cryptosporidium were isolated from calves
but not from other animals with which these subjects had been in contact. Oocysts
of cryptosporidium were also detected during repeated examinations of feces from 
two immunodeficient patients with persistent cryptosporidiosis. An apparently
identical infection was transmitted to calves and mice, using oocysts from
infected calves and human beings. Oocysts from an immunodeficient person also
produced infections in kittens, puppies, and goats. This study shows that
cryptosporidium may produce a moderate self-limited illness in immunocompetent
persons, which contrasts sharply with the prolonged severe diarrhea in
immunocompromised patients who contract cryptosporidiosis. Calves with diarrhea
should be considered a potential source of human infection, and immunocompromised
persons should avoid contact with such animals.

Evidence for liver disease preceding amino acid abnormalities in hereditary
tyrosinemia.

Hostetter MK, Levy HL, Winter HS, Knight GJ, Haddow JE.

In hereditary tyrosinemia, an autosomal recessive disorder of infants, it has
been postulated that hepatic toxicity arising from defective degradation of
tyrosine accounts for the severe liver disease that is a feature of this
condition. We measured the concentration of alpha-fetoprotein, a marker for liver
disease, and of amino acid in cord blood from three infants with hereditary
tyrosinemia and found that the concentration of alpha-fetoprotein was greatly
increased at birth, whereas the level of tyrosine was normal or not specifically 
elevated, and that hypertyrosinemia developed only postnatally. These results
indicate that liver disease is prenatal in hereditary tyrosinemia and that
therapy aimed at reduction of the elevated tyrosine level is unlikely to be of
fundamental value.

Tubulo-interstitial nephritis associated with polyomavirus (BK type) infection.

Rosen S, Harmon W, Krensky AM, Edelson PJ, Padgett BL, Grinnell BW, Rubino MJ,
Walker DL.

We studied viral injury to the kidney in a six-year-old boy with
hyperimmunoglobulin M immunodeficiency who presented with irreversible acute
renal failure and eventually died after five months of dialysis. Renal biopsy at 
the time of his presentation revealed a predominantly tubulo-interstitial process
with numerous viral inclusions that were identified as polyomavirus. Urine
cultures showed a massive viruria with BK-type, polyomavirus. The kidney disease 
was end stage, with persistence of BK virus identified by morphologic techniques 
and by culture. DNA hybridization analysis showed virus in low concentration in
the lymph nodes, spleen, and lungs. The marked viruria, the high concentration of
BK virus, and the extensive distribution of viral antigen throughout the kidney
all suggest that infection with BK virus was the basis of the severe renal
parenchymal injury.

Spirochetes isolated from the blood of two patients with Lyme disease.

Benach JL, Bosler EM, Hanrahan JP, Coleman JL, Habicht GS, Bast TF, Cameron DJ,
Ziegler JL, Barbour AG, Burgdorfer W, Edelman R, Kaslow RA.

We isolated spirochetes from the blood of 2 of 36 patients in Long Island and
Westchester County, New York, who had signs and symptoms suggestive of Lyme
disease. The spirochetes were morphologically similar and serologically identical
to organisms recently found to infect lxodes dammini ticks, which are endemic to 
the area and have been epidemiologically implicated as vectors of Lyme disease.
In both patients, there was a rise in specific antispirochetal antibodies in
paired specimens of serum. We conclude that the l. dammini spirochete has an
etiologic role in Lyme disease.

Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare Escherichia coli serotype.

Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, McGee HB, Wells JG, Davis BR, Hebert RJ, Olcott
ES, Johnson LM, Hargrett NT, Blake PA, Cohen ML.

We investigated two outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that
affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and 
May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal
pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little
or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same
fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P =
0.0005) and with eating any of three sandwiches containing three ingredients in
common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield
previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare Escherichia coli serotype,
O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9
of 12 stools collected within four days of onset of illness in both outbreaks
combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The
only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of
hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive
gastrointestinal illness associated with E. coli O157:H7, apparently transmitted 
by undercooked meat.

No increase in second tumors after cytotoxic chemotherapy for gestational
trophoblastic tumors.

Rustin GJ, Rustin F, Dent J, Booth M, Salt S, Bagshawe KD.

We investigated the incidence of second tumors after cytotoxic chemotherapy in
457 long-term survivors treated for choriocarcinoma or an invasive mole between
1958 and 1978. Treatment was given according to regular intermittent schedules
and over a mean period of four months, with no maintenance. Methotrexate was
given to all but two patients, and 261 (57 per cent) also received other
cytotoxic drugs, most commonly dactinomycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
mercaptopurine, and 6-azauridine. After a mean period of 7.8 years since the
beginning of treatment and a total of 3522 patient-years of risk, second
neoplasms had developed in only two women (acute leukemia in one and carcinoma of
the breast in the other). This figure is less than the number of cases of cancer 
that would have been expected (3.5) in this group and suggests that the use of
methotrexate as chemotherapy for choriocarcinoma is not carcinogenic in the
medium term.

Running--an analogue of anorexia?

Yates A, Leehey K, Shisslak CM.

We have explored the apparent similarity between patients with anorexia nervosa
and a subgroup of male athletes designated as "obligatory runners." Case examples
are provided from interviews with more than 60 marathon and trail runners.
Obligatory runners resemble anorexic women in terms of family background;
socioeconomic class; and such personality characteristics as inhibition of anger,
extraordinarily high self-expectations, tolerance of physical discomfort, denial 
of potentially serious debility, and a tendency toward depression. Anorexic women
and members of their families are often compulsively athletic, and obligatory
runners may demonstrate a bizarre preoccupation with food and an unusual emphasis
on lean body mass. We speculate that both phenomena could represent a partially
successful--albeit dangerous--attempt to establish an identity. These preliminary
observations will require further study for validation.

5-azacytidine selectively increases gamma-globin synthesis in a patient with
beta+ thalassemia.

Ley TJ, DeSimone J, Anagnou NP, Keller GH, Humphries RK, Turner PH, Young NS,
Keller P, Nienhuis AW.

5-Azacytidine is a cytidine analogue that is capable of activating repressed
genes in tissue-culture cells and has been shown to increase hemoglobin-F
production in anemic baboons. This drug was administered to a patient with severe
beta-thalassemia in an attempt to stimulate hemoglobin-F production. After seven 
days of 5-azacytidine treatment, gamma-globin synthesis increased approximately
sevenfold, temporarily normalizing the patient's unbalanced globin synthesis.
Erythropoiesis became more effective, leading to a temporary increase in the
absolute reticulocyte count (from 5000 to 22,000 per cubic millimeter) and in
hemoglobin concentration (from 8.0 to 10.8 g per deciliter). Hypomethylation of
bone-marrow DNA near both the gamma-globin and epsilon-globin genes was directly 
demonstrated. At the time of peak drug effect, about 7000 gamma-globin messenger 
RNA molecules were present per erythroid bone-marrow cell, in contrast to 10 to
15 epsilon-globin messenger RNA molecules per cell. 5-Azacytidine selectivity
increases gamma-globin synthesis and therefore provides a new approach to the
treatment of severe beta-thalassemia. Further studies will be required to
evaluate the efficacy, risks, and long-term toxicity of 5-azacytidine (or related
compounds) before this approach can be used as a therapy for patients with
disorders of hemoglobin synthesis.

Hypoglycemia associated with antibodies to the insulin receptor.

Taylor SI, Grunberger G, Marcus-Samuels B, Underhill LH, Dons RF, Ryan J, Roddam 
RF, Rupe CE, Gorden P.

Antibodies to the insulin receptor are insulinomimetic in vitro, although they
generally induce insulin resistance in vivo. We report the novel case of a
patient who presented with fasting hypoglycemia as the sole manifestation of
autoantibodies to the insulin receptor. Prednisone therapy (120 mg per day)
produced a rise in fasting glucose to more than 100 mg per deciliter (6 mmol per 
liter) within 48 hours, although there was no detectable change in the titer of
antireceptor antibodies. After 10 weeks of therapy, the titer of antireceptor
antibodies had fallen approximately 100-fold, and prednisone could be
discontinued without recurrence of hypoglycemia. This case demonstrates that
antireceptor antibodies must be considered in the differential diagnosis of
hypoglycemia, especially in patients with other manifestations of autoimmunity.

A genetic defect in the binding of protein 4.1 to spectrin in a kindred with
hereditary spherocytosis.

Wolfe LC, John KM, Falcone JC, Byrne AM, Lux SE.

Indirect evidence suggests that the genetic defect in hereditary spherocytosis
lies in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, a submembranous meshwork of proteins
(principally spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1) responsible for membrane shape and
structural stability. To test this premise we systematically assayed the
interactions of spectrin, the major skeletal protein, in six kindreds with
autosomal dominant hereditary spherocytosis. In one these kindreds, enhancement
of spectrin-actin binding by protein 4.1 was reduced, owing to a 39 +/- 4 per
cent decrease (mean +/- S.D) in the binding of normal protein 4.1 by spectrin, in
all of four members with the disorder. The defective spectrin was separated into 
two populations by affinity chromatography on immobilized normal protein 4.1. One
population (41 +/- 2 per cent) lacked the ability to bind 4.1, but the other
functioned normally. Presumable, the nonfunctional spectrin was the product of
the autosomal dominant gene responsible for the hereditary spherocytosis in this 
kindred.

Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Weekly clinicopathological
exercises. Case 40-1982. Tender hepatomegaly in a 29-year-old woman.

[No authors listed]

PIP: A case is described wherein a 29 year old woman was admitted to the hospital
because of the possibility of a hepatic tumor; symptoms included abdominal pain, 
diffuse hepatic enlargement and absence of uptake in an area of the right hepatic
lobe. After a normal pregnancy and delivery 11 years earlier the patient used
oral contraceptives (OCs) composed of norethindrone with mestranol until 8 years 
before entry; 5 years before admission she resumed use of an OC containing
norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol. She smoked 1.5 packages of cigarettes and
drank 1 glass of wine daily, and there was no history of nausea, vomiting,
melena, jaundice, dark urine, light stools, hepatitis, or blood transfusions.
Benign lesions which are known to be caused by OCs fall into 2 groups: designated
focal nodular hyperplasia and liver-cell adenoma. The evidence linking the latter
with OCs is more convincing since in case-controlled studies the risk of
development of adenomas has been shown to increase with the estrogen strength of 
the OCs and duration of use; in women who have been taking OCs over 7 years the
relative risk is 500 times that for matched control nonusers. The vascular
complications of OC therapy include Budd-Chiari syndrome, peliosis hepatis, and
periportal sinusoidal dilatation. The patient in this case was diagnosed to have 
periportal and midzonal hepatic sinusoidal dilatation association with OC
medication. She underwent an operation on her liver which proved to be successful
combined with cessation of OC use. The mechanism by which OCs cause these lesions
is not known. In 5 of 13 cases similar to the one described here clinical and
biochemical abnormalities resolved and 1 patient had a follow-up liver biopsy
that revealed normal findings 10 months after cessation of OC therapy; there is
no evidence to suggest that sinusoidal dilatation is irreversible.

Histological osteomalacia due to dietary calcium deficiency in children.

Marie PJ, Pettifor JM, Ross FP, Glorieux FH.

We performed a histomorphometric study of trabecular-bone formation and
resorption in undecalcified sections of iliac crest from three children
presenting with clinical, radiologic, and biochemical evidence of rickets
associated with dietary calcium deficiency. All three children had severe
osteomalacia documented by hyperosteoidosis and reduced static and dynamic
indicators of bone mineralization. There was a reduction of the calcified bone
volume associated with a decreased bone formation rate and features of increased 
bone resorption. Correction of dietary calcium intake in two of the patients led 
to normal serum and urinary calcium levels and reduced alkaline phosphatase
levels. After calcium therapy, the calcified bone volume was normal and
indicators of bone mineralization returned to normal. We conclude that low
calcium intake in children may be associated with a histologic picture of severe 
osteomalacia. Our finding that adequate amounts of calcium rapidly improved bone 
mineralization demonstrates that calcium deficiency can cause osteomalacia in
children.

Hepatic copper overload and features of Indian childhood cirrhosis in an American
sibship.

Lefkowitch JH, Honig CL, King ME, Hagstrom JW.

We studied the clinical histories of four white American siblings who died at
41/2 to six years of age of an unknown form of cirrhosis, in an effort to
identify the etiologic factors in this familial syndrome. The family history
disclosed no Indian heritage or parental consanguinity. The children were born
and raised in New Jersey. Each had been well until progressive lethargy,
abdominal swelling, jaundice, and fever developed four to seven months before
death. The liver histopathology in each case closely resembled that of Indian
childhood cirrhosis and included severe panlobular liver-cell swelling with
Mallory body formation, prominent pericellular fibrosis, "micro-micronodular"
cirrhosis, and marked deposits of copper and copper-binding protein. Hepatic
copper levels were as high as 2083 microgram per gram of tissue (normal, less
than 50 microgram). A number of features distinguish this syndrome from Wilson's 
disease and familial cholestatic disorders of childhood. A genetically determined
disturbance in copper metabolism appears to be the most likely cause.

Myelomatosis with type III hyperlipoproteinemia: clinical and metabolic studies.

Cortese C, Lewis B, Miller NE, Peyman MA, Rao SN, Slavin B, Sule U, Turner PR,
Utermann G, Wing AJ, Weight M, Wootton R.

We investigated the metabolism of intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL [1.006
to 1.019 g per milliliter]) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL [1.019 to 1.063 g
per milliliter]) in two men with Type III hyperlipoproteinemia associated with
myelomatosis. In vivo kinetic studies using radiolabeled autologous lipoproteins 
demonstrated a greatly reduced fractional catabolic rate of IDL, relative to
control values (patients vs. normal, 0.006 and 0.025 per hour vs. 0.20 +/- 0.08
per hour [mean +/- S.E.M]) and a greatly prolonged IDL-to-LDL conversion time (45
and 17 hours vs. 5.4 +/- 1.6 hours). In studies in vitro, LDL from both patients 
failed to bind to the LDL receptor of normal blood lymphocytes, whereas LDL from 
subjects with familial Type III hyperlipoproteinemia bound normally to the
receptor. In one patient immunoglobulin was shown to be associated with IDL and
LDL. Thus, hyperlipoproteinemia reflected an impaired metabolism of IDL, probably
secondary to the binding of immunoglobulin to the lipoproteins. A similar
impairment of receptor-mediated LDL catabolism did not elevate the plasma LDL
concentration because of the low IDL-to-LDL conversion rate.

Familial deficiency of apolipoproteins A-I and C-III and precocious
coronary-artery disease.

Norum RA, Lakier JB, Goldstein S, Angel A, Goldberg RB, Block WD, Noffze DK,
Dolphin PJ, Edelglass J, Bogorad DD, Alaupovic P.

We studied two sisters 29 and 31 years old who had skin and tendon xanthomas,
corneal clouding, and severe coronary atherosclerosis. Histologic examination
showed collections of lipid-laden histiocytes in the skin. The patients' plasma
cholesterol concentrations were 177 and 135 mg per deciliter (4.58 and 3.49 mmol 
per liter). Levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were 4 and 7 mg per
deciliter (0.1 and 0.2 mmol per liter). Only traces of apolipoprotein A-I were
detected in whole plasma. The plasma density fraction from 1.06 to 1.21 g per
milliliter contained no high-density lipoprotein on high-pressure liquid
chromatography, no apolipoprotein A-I on sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis, 
and only traces of apolipoprotein A-I on radioimmunoassay. Apolipoprotein C-III
was also not detectable. The activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase was
40 per cent of normal. The half-life of infused normal high-density lipoprotein
was three days (normal, 5.8 days). The parents and children of these two patients
had low levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.
These cases support the hypothesis that low concentrations of high-density
lipoprotein promote atherosclerosis.

A surgical approach to the treatment of fetal hydrocephalus.

Clewell WH, Johnson ML, Meier PR, Newkirk JB, Zide SL, Hendee RW, Bowes WA Jr,
Hecht F, O'Keeffe D, Henry GP, Shikes RH.

Untreated fetal hydrocephalus results in gross cranial and facial abnormalities
and profound brain damage. In an attempt to prevent both, a ventriculoamniotic
shunt was implanted in a fetus with probable X-linked aqueductal stenosis and
hydrocephalus. Performed at 24 weeks' gestation, the procedure used techniques
similar to those used for intrauterine transfusion. After shunt placement, the
fetal head size grew normally until after the 32d week, when the shunt failed. A 
cesarean delivery was performed at 34 weeks' gestation. The infant received a
standard ventriculoperitoneal shunt after delivery, and his neonatal course has
been evaluated through the first three months of life. In selected cases, the
ventriculoamniotic shunt may be an acceptable treatment for fetal hydrocephalus.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy.

Cines DB, Dusak B, Tomaski A, Mennuti M, Schreiber AD.

Neonatal thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening complication of
immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). We followed 23 pregnant women who had
either a history of ITP (11 women) or clinically active disease (12 women) to
delineate the factors responsible for neonatal thrombocytopenia. No relation was 
observed between maternal and neonatal platelet counts (P greater than 0.5).
Eleven women delivered thrombocytopenic children; antiplatelet antibodies were
detectable in each mother, including five who were in clinical remission at
delivery. The level of platelet-associated IgG in the mothers did not identify
the neonates at risk for thrombocytopenia (P greater than 0.05). However, the
level of maternal circulating antiplatelet antibody correlated with both the
presence and the extent of neonatal thrombocytopenia (P less than 0.005). A
discrepancy between maternal platelet count and maternal antibody level may be
especially notable in mothers treated with steroids or splenectomy. Monitoring
the level of circulating antiplatelet antibody may help in identifying and
managing pregnant women with ITP at risk of delivering neonates with serious
thrombocytopenia.

Fetal echocardiography for evaluation of in utero congestive heart failure.

Kleinman CS, Donnerstein RL, DeVore GR, Jaffe CC, Lynch DC, Berkowitz RL, Talner 
NS, Hobbins JC.

Thirteen fetuses with nonimmune hydrops (22 to 39 weeks of gestation) were
evaluated with two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography. Ten fetuses had
cardiovascular abnormalities resulting in heart failure, and three had noncardiac
causes of hydrops. In three cases, hydrops was caused by supraventricular
tachycardia. One of these fetuses responded to cardioversion at birth, another
responded to transplacental digoxin therapy, and the third died with atrial
flutter and high-grade atrioventricular block before delivery. There were no
cases of "idiopathic" hydrops. Our results show that fetal echocardiography is
useful in determining cardiac causes of in utero heart failure resulting in
hydrops fetalis. The fetal echocardiogram may also be used in monitoring
transplacental therapy of heart failure.

Heart-lung transplantation: successful therapy for patients with pulmonary
vascular disease.

Reitz BA, Wallwork JL, Hunt SA, Pennock JL, Billingham ME, Oyer PE, Stinson EB,
Shumway NE.

We report our initial experience with three patients who received heart-lung
transplants. The primary immunosuppressive agent used was cyclosporin A, although
conventional drugs were also administered. In the first patient, a 45-year-old
woman with primary pulmonary hypertension, acute rejection of the transplant was 
diagnosed 10 and 25 days after surgery but was treated successfully; this patient
still had normal exercise tolerance 10 months late. The second patient, a
30-year-old man, underwent transplantation for Eisenmenger's syndrome due to
atrial and ventricular septal defects. His graft was not rejected, and his
condition was markedly improved eight months after surgery. The third patient, a 
29-year-old woman with transposition of the great vessels and associated defects,
died four days postoperatively of renal, hepatic, and pulmonary complications. We
attribute our success to experience with heart-lung transplantation in primates, 
to the use of cyclosporin A, and to the anatomic and physiologic advantages of
combined heart-lung replacement. We hope that such transplants may ultimately
provide an improved outlook for selected terminally ill patients with pulmonary
vascular disease and certain other intractable cardiopulmonary disorders.

Pseudo-von Willebrand's disease. An intrinsic platelet defect with aggregation by
unmodified human factor VIII/von Willebrand factor and enhanced adsorption of its
high-molecular-weight multimers.

Weiss HJ, Meyer D, Rabinowitz R, Pietu G, Girma JP, Vicic WJ, Rogers J.

Four members (from four generations) of a family with a mild bleeding disorder
and intermittent thrombocytopenia had decreased plasma levels of properties
related to factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/VWF), an absence of
high-molecular-weight forms of FVIII/VWF in the plasma (but normal multimeric
structure in the platelets), and increased ristocetin-induced platelet
aggregation, as in Type IIB von Willebrand's disease. However, unlike the
abnormality in FVIII/VWF in Type IIB disease, the basic defect in this family was
in their platelets, which absorbed FVIII/VWF high-molecular-weight multimers at
lower concentrations of ristocetin than did normal platelets. In addition, either
in platelet-rich plasma or suspended in buffer, their platelets were aggregated
by unmodified normal human FVIII/VWF without ristocetin. Since the abnormalities 
of plasma FVIII/VWF in this family may be secondary to the platelet
abnormalities, the term "pseudo-von Willbrand's disease" may be suitably
descriptive of their disorder.

An association between neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism and familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia in three kindreds.

Marx SJ, Attie MF, Spiegel AM, Levine MA, Lasker RD, Fox M.

Four cases of neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism occurred in three
families; familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia was present in each kindred. The
diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia was based on the following
features; hypercalcemia in many relatives (eight to 16 per kindred), without
other features of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes; recognition of
hypercalcemia before the age of 10 in one to three relatives; hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia in all relatives tested (five to 14 per kindred); and abnormal
serum calcium levels despite parathyroidectomy in all additional relatives (one
to five per kindred) undergoing this operation. The association of two uncommon
syndromes (neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia) in these kindreds suggests that the two syndromes share a common
genetic cause within each kindred.

Recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis after liver transplantation.

Neuberger J, Portmann B, Macdougall BR, Calne RY, Williams R.

Three patients who had undergone orthrotopic liver transplantation for primary
biliary cirrhosis and were being maintained on immunosuppressive therapy were
investigated 31/2 to 41/2 years later because of the redevelopment of pruritus
and mild jaundice. In one patient pigmentation was again evident, and all three
had a rise in the titer of serum mitochondrial antibody after an initial fall.
Liver histology showed features of primary biliary cirrhosis with non-suppurative
destructive cholangitis, lymphoid aggregates, and increased deposition of
copper-binding protein in the absence of cholestasis. None of these features was 
found in patients who had received grafts for other conditions and had lived for 
comparable periods, nor were they found in patients who had had rejection with
bile-duct abnormalities. The overall findings indicate a recurrence of primary
biliary cirrhosis in the donor organ.

Severe acquired immunodeficiency in male homosexuals, manifested by chronic
perianal ulcerative herpes simplex lesions.

Siegal FP, Lopez C, Hammer GS, Brown AE, Kornfeld SJ, Gold J, Hassett J,
Hirschman SZ, Cunningham-Rundles C, Adelsberg BR, et al.

Four homosexual men presented with gradually enlarging perianal ulcers, from
which herpes simplex virus was cultured. Each patient had a prolonged course
characterized by eight loss, fever, and evidence of infection by other
opportunistic microorganisms including cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, and
Candida albicans. Three patients died; Kaposi's sarcoma developed in the fourth. 
All were found to have depressed cell-mediated immunity, as evidenced by skin
anergy, lymphopenia, and poor or absent responses to plant lectins and antigens
in vitro. Natural-killer-cell activity directed against target cells infected
with herpes simplex virus was depressed in all patients. The absence of a history
of recurrent infections or of histologic evidence of lymphoproliferative or other
neoplastic diseases suggests that the immune defects were acquired.

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and mucosal candidiasis in previously healthy
homosexual men: evidence of a new acquired cellular immunodeficiency.

Gottlieb MS, Schroff R, Schanker HM, Weisman JD, Fan PT, Wolf RA, Saxon A.

Four previously healthy homosexual men contracted Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
extensive mucosal candidiasis, and multiple viral infections. In three of the
patients these infections followed prolonged fevers of unknown origin. In all
four cytomegalovirus was recovered from secretions. Kaposi's sarcoma developed in
one patient eight months after he presented with esophageal candidiasis. All
patients were anergic and lymphopenic; they had no lymphocyte proliferative
responses to soluble antigens, and their responses to phytohemagglutinin were
markedly reduced. Monoclonal-antibody analysis of peripheral-blood T-cell
subpopulations revealed virtual elimination of the Leu-3 / helper/inducer subset,
an increased percentage of the Leu-2 + suppressor/cytoxic subset, and an
increased percentage of cells bearing the thymocyte-associated antigen T10. The
inversion of the T/ helper to suppressor/cytotoxic ratio suggested that
cytomegalovirus infection was an important factor in the pathogenesis of the
immunodeficient state. A high level of exposure of male homosexuals to
cytomegalovirus-infected secretions may account for the occurrence of this immune
deficiency.

Biochemical evidence of dysfunction of brain neurotransmitters in the Lesch-Nyhan
syndrome.

Lloyd KG, Hornykiewicz O, Davidson L, Shannak K, Farley I, Goldstein M, Shibuya
M, Kelley WN, Fox IH.

Different brain regions were removed post mortem from three patients with the
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and were examined for alterations in hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), adenine phosphoribosyl transferase, and
biochemical indexes of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA), and acetylcholine neuron function, as compared with age-matched
controls. The level of HGPRT activity in the material from patients with the
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome was less than 1 per cent of control levels, whereas adenyl
phosphoribosyl transferase was not significantly altered. All biochemical aspects
of the function of dopamine-neuron terminals in the striatum (except
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels) were decreased to 10 to 30 per cent of the
control values. Serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were increased,
striatal choline acetyltransferase levels were low, and striatal glutamic acid
decarboxylase and guanylate cyclase activities were unaltered. The disruption of 
the balance between the functions of GABA, dopamine, and acetylcholine neurons in
the extrapyramidal system probably accounts for some of the symptoms observed in 
the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (e.g., choreoathetosis).

Pathology and probabilities: a new approach to interpreting and reporting
biopsies.

Schwartz WB, Wolfe HJ, Pauker SG.

Pathologists typically analyze biopsy specimens and report their opinions in a
qualitative fashion. Clinical information, often fragmentary in character, is
implicitly linked with the histologic findings, and interpretations are couched
in ambiguous language: "consistent with," "highly suggestive of," "may
represent," or "cannot exclude." Only pathognomonic or normal findings are
reported in an unequivocal fashion. In this paper we compare the analysis of
biopsy material by a conventional method and by a numerical, probabilistic
technique. We suggest that applying a probabilistic technique can considerably
improve the precision of tissue diagnosis and can greatly facilitate the
communication of pathologists with clinicians and with each other. Probabilistic 
analysis is also likely to be of substantial value in improving the
interpretation and reporting of x-ray and nuclear-medicine studies.

Predisposition to phenytoin hepatotoxicity assessed in vitro.

Spielberg SP, Gordon GB, Blake DA, Goldstein DA, Herlong HF.

Arene oxide metabolites of phenytoin may be involved in the pathogenesis of
drug-induced hepatotoxicity. We examined individual susceptibility to toxicity
from such metabolites by exposing human lymphocytes to metabolites generated by a
murine hepatic microsomal system. Cells from 17 controls showed no toxicity at
concentrations of phenytoin from 31 to 125 microM. Cells from three patients with
phenytoin hepatotoxicity manifested dose-dependent toxicity from the metabolites.
Phenytoin alone was not toxic to cells. The patients' dose-response curves
resembled the response of control cells in which epoxide hydrolase (a
detoxification enzyme for arene oxides) was inhibited. Detoxification of
non-arene oxide metabolites (e.g., of acetaminophen) was normal in patients'
cells. Cells from parents of two patients had intermediate responses. Cells from 
a sibling of one patient showed no toxicity; a sibling of another patient had a
response similar to that of the patient. A heritable defect in response to arene 
oxides thus may predispose some patients to phenytoin hepatotoxicity.

Chlamydia trachomatis proctitis.

Quinn TC, Goodell SE, Mkrtichian E, Schuffler MD, Wang SP, Stamm WE, Holmes KK.

One hundreds seventy-one homosexual men, 96 of whom had symptoms suggestive of
proctitis and 75 of whom had no such symptoms, were consecutively enrolled in a
study of the prevalence, clinical spectrum, and histopathology of Chlamydia
trachomatis rectal infections. C. trachomatis was isolated from the rectums of 14
men. Three of the isolates, which had lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) immunotypes,
were recovered from three men with symptoms and signs of severe proctitis, two of
whom had granulomatous inflammation that was observed at rectal biopsy and was
initially suggestive of Crohn's disease. Eleven isolates, which had non-LGV
immunotypes, were obtained from eight symptomatic and three asymptomatic men, all
of whom had fecal leukocytes and mild abnormalities of the mucosa present at
sigmoidoscopy, usually with mild nongranulomatous inflammatory changes that were 
seen on rectal biopsy. These observations suggest that the presence of LGV
immunotypes of C. trachomatis in the rectum is associated with severe acute
proctitis that mimics Crohn's disease of the rectum, whereas the non-LGV
immunotypes are associated with a mild proctitis with or without symptoms.

Selective birth in twin pregnancy with discordancy for Down's syndrome.

Kerenyi TD, Chitkara U.

PIP: Amniocentesis is used for detection of genetic abnormalities. One difficult 
problem to resolve is the consequence of finding 1 abnormal and 1 normal fetus in
cases of twin pregnancies. A review of the literature reveals 5 cases of 1
abnormal and 1 normal fetus in twin pregnancies. A most aggressive approach to
this problem is selective termination of the abnormal fetus by intracardiac
puncture and exsanguination. This report describes a case of twin pregnancy with 
discordancy for trisomy 21. Amniocentesis was performed on a 40-year-old
nullipara who was 17 weeks pregnant. Advanced maternal age was the indication for
the procedure. An ultrasound scan and chromosomal studies revealed twin fetuses, 
twin A with a normal karyotype (46, XY), and twin B with indicated trisomy 21
(46, XY + 21). After an extensive counseling session, the mother decided to
undergo selective termination of the abnormal fetus. At 20 weeks' gestation, the 
procedure was carried out under real-time ultrasound guidance as described. At 40
weeks gestation, the patient delivered a 2980 g living male infant and a 120 g
small, fibrosed, and infarcted fetus papyraceus (twin B). Both mother and
surviving infant continue to do well. The risks of performing selective
termination of abnormal fetuses, and technical considerations in this type of
procedure are discussed.

Failure of CT sharing in a large municipal hospital.

Brust JC, Dickinson PC, Healton EB.

Harlem Hospital Center lacks computed tomography (CT) facilities. During 1979 it 
attempted to share the CT facilities of two other institutions. Retrospective
analysis reveals that under this arrangement only a small percentage of Harlem
patients needing CT obtained it. Among patients recommended for CT, 252 of 1528
without trauma and six of 342 with trauma received it. In some instances there
were difficulties in moving patients between hospitals. If transportation had
been optimal, however, the other hospitals, because of their own needs, would
have been unable to provide Harlem Hospital with more than a third of the CT
scans requested. Furthermore, even if unlimited opportunities for scanning had
been available, patients whose need for CT seemed most urgent--the very
ill--would have been unable to receive it; of 163 patients who died without
receiving CT as recommended, 93 were too sick or deteriorating too rapidly to be 
moved to the CT facilities. We conclude that CT cannot be effectively shared by
large acute-care hospitals.

Activation of leukemic pro-suppressor cells to become suppressor-effector cells. 
Influence of cooperating normal T cells.

Broder S, Uchiyama T, Muul LM, Goldman C, Sharrow S, Poplack DG, Waldmann TA.

We studied the suppressor activity and surface-membrane antigens of
immunoregulatory neoplastic T cells from a child with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. The neoplastic T cells were potent inhibitors
of immunoglobulin production by pokeweed-mitogen-stimulated normal B cells when
radiosensitive cooperative normal T cells were present. Preculturing the leukemic
cells with normal T cells or soluble factors allowed them to mediate suppression 
without the need for cooperating T cells. While acquiring new functional
capabilities, approximately 95 per cent of the leukemic cells displayed an
antigen (OKT-3) that is found on mature normal T cells; 77 per cent displayed an 
antigen (Tac) that is found on normal activated immunoregulatory effector cells
but not on thymocytes or circulating T cells that are precursors of these
effector cells. The results suggest that a population of leukemic prosuppressor
cells can be induced to undergo both functional and antigenic differentiation by 
the influence of normal T cells.

Coronary-artery spasm immediately after myocardial revascularization: recognition
and management.

Buxton AE, Goldberg S, Harken A, Hirshfield J Jr, Kastor JA.

We investigated coronary-artery spasm in six patents who had had unexpected
hemodynamic collapse within two hours after cardiopulmonary bypass for myocardial
revascularization. All six had profound hypotension and recurrent ST-segment
elevation in electrocardiographic Leads II, III, and aVF. All had either normal
or noncritical luminal irregularities of dominant right coronary arteries and
more than 75 per cent occlusions in the left coronary circulation.
Right-coronary-artery spasm, which was reversed after intracoronary
nitroglycerin, was demonstrated angiographically in one patient; a patent right
coronary artery was found at autopsy in another patient. Three patients died
despite large intravenous doses of nitroglycerin. Two patients who had been
unresponsive to intravenous nitroglycerin recovered after direct infusion of
nitroglycerin into the right coronary artery. Coronary-artery spasm immediately
after myocardial revascularization may cause circulatory collapse and death;
although the spasm may be refractory to usual therapy, it may respond to
intracoronary nitroglycerin.

Pure alpha-secreting pituitary adenomas.

Ridgway EC, Klibanski A, Ladenson PW, Clemmons D, Beitins IZ, McArthur JW,
Martorana MA, Zervas NT.

Isolated hypersecretion of the alpha subunit of the glycoprotein hormones
occurred in two men with previously diagnosed "nonfunctioning chromophobe
adenomas." The alpha hypersecretion was unresponsive to hypothalamic releasing
hormone, thyroid hormone, and sex-steroid hormones. After trans-sphenoidal
surgery and conventional pituitary irradiation, alpha secretion was decreased.
Increased quantities of immunologically active and biologically inactive
luteinizing hormone (LH) material were detected in serum and in tumor homogenate.
Immunologic and gel-chromatographic studies determined that only the alpha
subunit was present and that it was cross-reacting in the LH immunoassay. These
studies suggest that the alpha subunit may be a useful marker of pituitary
tumors, particularly in patients without clinical evidence of hormonal
hypersecretion.

Hemodialysis using prostacyclin instead of heparin as the sole antithrombotic
agent.

Zusman RM, Rubin RH, Cato AE, Cocchetto DM, Crow JW, Tolkoff-Rubin N.

Anticoagulation during hemodialysis is necessary to prevent clotting of the blood
on contact with the dialysis membrane. Heparin is the usual anticoagulant used,
but systemic anticoagulation may persist for hours, and hemorrhage is common. We 
successfully used an infusion of prostacyclin, which has an in vitro half-life of
three to five minutes, as the sole anticoagulant in 10 patients on long-term
hemodialysis and in one patient undergoing dialysis for acute renal failure (this
patient bled severely on three occasions when heparin was used). Prostacyclin was
infused intravenously for 10 minutes before dialysis and into the arterial line
of the dialyzer during dialysis. We adjusted the rate of infusion into the
dialyzer to prevent prostacyclin-induced hypotension. Each patient completed 240 
minutes of dialysis and received a total of 423 +/- 91 ng of prostacyclin per
kilogram of body weight (mean +/- S.E.M.; range, 56 to 780). Prostacyclin caused 
no clinically important changes in the intrinsic clotting system, and there were 
no hemorrhages or clotting of the coil. We conclude that prostacyclin can safely 
replace heparin as the sole antithrombotic agent during hemodialysis and may be
more advantageous if anticoagulation is contraindicated.

A naturally occurring antibody that inhibits fibrin polymerization.

Hoots WK, Carrell NA, Wagner RH, Cooper HA, McDonagh J.

A 13-year-old girl with chronic aggressive hepatitis, postnecrotic cirrhosis,
ulcerative colitis, and a coagulation defect acquired an antibody that
specifically interfered with fibrin formation. We sought to characterize the
antibody and determine the mechanism of its inhibitory activity. The patient's
purified fibrinogen was functionally normal; however, the antibody inhibited the 
self-assembly of fibrin and prolonged the clotting times of the patient's plasma.
This antibody, which belonged to the IgG class of immunoglobulins, acted early in
the polymerization process to inhibit the association of fibrin monomers, as
indicated by a prolonged lag time and a decreased slope in the polymerization
curves. It did not inhibit fibrinopeptide cleavage or fibrin cross-linking.
Affinity chromatography indicated that the antibody bound strongly to both
fibrinogen and fibrin monomer.

Immunodeficiency associated with loss of T4+ inducer T-cell function.

Reinherz EL, Geha R, Wohl ME, Morimoto C, Rosen FS, Schlossman SF.

We investigated the immune function of a patient with anergy and acquired
hypogammaglobulinemia. Despite normal numbers of B cells and T4+ inducer and T5+ 
suppressor T cells, this patient's lymphocytes did not produce immunoglobulin,
proliferate in response to soluble antigens, or generate helper factors in vitro.
In addition, her T4+ T cells did not express la molecules after stimulation by
soluble antigen. In mixing experiments, her T cells did not induce immunoglobulin
secretion by B cells from a normal, HLA-D-identical sibling; this failure was not
due to excessive suppression, since the patient's T cells did not abrogate
immunoglobulin production by the normal sibling's T and B cells. Moreover, the
patient's B cells secreted immunoglobulin in the presence of the sibling's T4+
cells. In contrast to the deficient inducer cells, the patient's T5+ T cells were
capable of expressing suppressor-cell functions. These results indicate that
immunodeficiency may occur because of a selective loss of T4+ inducer function.

Deleterious effect of prednisolone in HBsAg-positive chronic active hepatitis.

Lam KC, Lai CL, Trepo C, Wu PC.

To study the efficacy of corticosteroids in chronic active hepatitis (CAH)
positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), we pair-randomized 51 patients 
to receive either 15 to 20 mg of prednisolone per day or a placebo. After initial
remission, the maintenance dosage of prednisolone was 10 mg per day, and the
patients were prospectively followed for up to 3 1/2 years. Prednisolone
decreased serum bilirubin (P < 0.05) and globulin (P < 0.01) at three months; it 
delayed other biochemical remission occurring after the second month of
medication (P < 0.001); it hastened biochemical relapse (P < 0.0001); and it
increased the frequency of complications (P < 0.0001) and the death rate (P <
0.01). We conclude that prednisolone has an overall harmful effect in patients
with HBsAg-positive CAH.

Toxic-shock syndrome in menstruating women: association with tampon use and
Staphylococcus aureus and clinical features in 52 cases.

Shands KN, Schmid GP, Dan BB, Blum D, Guidotti RJ, Hargrett NT, Anderson RL, Hill
DL, Broome CV, Band JD, Fraser DW.

To determine the risk factors associated with toxic-shock syndrome (TSS) in
menstruating women, we conducted a retrospective telephone study of 52 cases and 
52 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Fifty-two cases and 44 controls used
tampons (P < 0.02). Moreover, in case-control pairs in which both women used
tampons, cases were more likely than controls to use tampons throughout
menstruation (42 of 44 vs. 34 of 44, respectively; P < 0.05). There were no
significant differences in brand of tampon used, degree of absorbency specified
on label, frequency of tampon change, type of contraceptive used, frequency of
sexual intercourse, or sexual intercourse during menstruation. Fourteen of 44
cases had one or more definite or probable recurrences during a subsequent
menstrual period. In a separate study, Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 62
of 64 women with TSS and from seven of 71 vaginal cultures obtained from healthy 
controls (P < 0.001).

Systemic carnitine deficiency--a treatable inherited lipid-storage disease
presenting as Reye's syndrome.

Chapoy PR, Angelini C, Brown WJ, Stiff JE, Shug AL, Cederbaum SD.

A 3 1/2-year-old boy presented at three months of age with an acute episode of
lethargy, somnolence, hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and cardiomegaly, which
responded poorly to restoration of the blood sugar level to normal. The absence
of ketonuria during subsequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia prompted a search 
for a defect in fatty acid oxidation. Plasma carnitine (2.0 to 5.0 mumol per
liter), muscle carnitine (0.01 to 0.02 mumol per gram, wet weight) and liver
carnitine (0.021 to 0.065 mumol per gram, wet weight) were all less than 5 per
cent of the normal mean. During a 36-hour fast, ketones were barely detectable.
Prolonged treatment with oral carnitine over a six-month period resulted in
increased muscle strength, a dramatic reduction in cardiac size, relief of
cardiomyopathy, partial repletion of carnitine levels in plasma and muscle, and
complete repletion in the liver. Systemic carnitine deficiency is an easily
treatable cause of recurrent Reye's-like syndrome. Its diagnosis requires
measurement of carnitine levels.

Treatment of the bleeding tendency in uremia with cryoprecipitate.

Janson PA, Jubelirer SJ, Weinstein MJ, Deykin D.

We gave cryoprecipitate to six patients with uremia and bleeding times prolonged 
to more than 15 minutes. After the infusion, all patients had shortened bleeding 
times; the times of five became normal. In four patients control of major
bleeding episodes was attained, and five underwent major surgical or invasive
procedures, with good hemostasis. After infusion the time before the nadir of the
bleeding time was reached was between one and 12 hours. The bleeding time
returned to pretreatment levels by 24 hours after infusion in five patients, and 
by 36 hours in the other patient. Platelet-aggregation studies before infusion
gave normal results in three patients and abnormal results in three. There wasno 
change after infusion. Before infusion, levels of Factor VIII coagulant activity 
and Factor VIII von Willebrand activity were normal, Factor VIII-related antigen 
was increased, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis of Factor VIII-related antigen
was normal. Our findings suggest that cryoprecipitate can temporarily correct the
bleeding tendency in patients with uremia.

An immunoglobulin (IgG) inhibitor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte motility in a
patient with recurrent infection.

Kramer N, Perez HD, Goldstein IM.

We isolated from the serum of a patient with recurrent skin infections an IgG
immunoglobulin that irreversibly inhibits the random motility and chemotactic
responsiveness of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Although the patient's leukocytes
behaved like normal cells with respect to adherence, phagocytosis, degranulation,
and generation of the superoxide anion, they did not migrate normally toward
standard chemotactic stimuli. Normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes behaved
similarly after incubation with the patient's serum. Inhibition of motility was
not associated with cyutotoxicity. Inhibitory activity could be removed
completely from the patient's serum by treatment with either agarose-bound
anti-human IgG or Sepharose-bound staphylococcal protein A. Exposure of normal
polymorphonuclear leukocytes to as little as 1.25 microgram per milliliter
(0.00125 g per liter) of the patient's purified IgG caused significant inhibition
of random motility and chemotactic responsiveness (P < 0.01). Thus, IgG
immunoglobulins can inhibit leukocyte motility specifically and irreversibly, and
thereby adversely affect host defenses against invading microorganisms.

A study of induced hyponatremia in the prevention and treatment of sickle-cell
crisis.

Rosa RM, Bierer BE, Thomas R, Stoff JS, Kruskall M, Robinson S, Bunn HF, Epstein 
FH.

Because the formation of sickle cells is dependent on the intracellular
concentration of deoxyhemoglobin S, we investigated the possibility of altering
or preventing sickle-cell crises by reducing serum sodium so as to cause red
cells to swell. In three patients with sickle-cell anemia who had been disabled
by recurrent painful crises, sustained dilutional hyponatremia was induced by
1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) in combination with a high fluid
intake. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration fell, and the degree of
sickling at low partial oxygen pressure was reduced, as determined by morphologic
criteria and by increased oxygen affinity of blood. Chronic hyponatremia (serum
sodium, 120 to 125 mmol per liter) reduced the frequency of painful crises,
whereas acutely induced hyponatremia abbreviated the duration of crises. These
results, although preliminary, are encouraging enough to warrant further study of
the safety and effectiveness of induced hyponatremia in the prevention and
treatment of sickle-cell crises.

Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia.

Cines DB, Kaywin P, Bina M, Tomaski A, Schreiber AD.

We studied the mechanism of platelet injury in 20 patients receiving heparin,
three of whom became thrombocytopenic. Platelets from these three patients had
increased levels of IgG and C3, which correlated with the presence of
thrombocytopenia; their plasma caused the release of serotonin from normal
platelets at concentrations of heparin within the usual therapeutic range. This
reaction required IgG and an intact classic complement pathway. The 17 patients
receiving heparin in whom thrombocytopenia did not develop had normal levels of
platelet-associated IgG and C3. Plasma from 14 of these patients caused the
release of serotonin, but only at heparin concentrations above the therapeutic
range, in a reaction that also required IgG and complement. The addition of
heparin to 15 normal plasma samples did not cause platelet injury in vitro. These
studies indicate that heparin administration can be associated with
complement-mediated platlet injury. The dose-dependent nature of this process may
account for the occurrence of thrombocytopenia in some of these patients.

Development of a scleroderma-like illness during therapy with
L-5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa.

Sternberg EM, Van Woert MH, Young SN, Magnussen I, Baker H, Gauthier S, Osterland
CK.

A scleroderma-like illness developed in a patient treated with L-5
hydroxytryptophan (L-5HTP) and carbidopa for intention myoclonus. The patient had
high plasma kynurenine levels that remained high when the L-5HTP-carbidopa
combination was discontinued, However, levels rose futher on drug rechallenge,
suggesting that the drug unmasked an abnormality in one of the enzymes that
catabolize kynurenine. Plasma kynurenine was also determined to be high in seven 
of 15 patients wth idiopathic scleroderma, but not in eight patients with
intention myoclonus treated with L-5HTP and a decarboxylase inhibitor and in whom
scleroderma did not develop or in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease treated
wth L-dopa and carbidopa. Our data and studies in the literature suggest that two
factors may be important in the pathogenesis of some scleroderma-like illness:
high plasma serotonin and the abnormality associated with elevated kynurenine.

Fetal hydantoin syndrome, neuroblastoma, and hemorrhagic disease in a neonate.

Allen RW Jr, Ogden B, Bentley FL, Jung AL.

This is the first patient report of maternal ingestion of anticonvulsants
associated with the triad of fetal hydantoin syndrome, neuroblastoma, and
hemorrhagic disease. The neuroblastoma, a neural crest tumor, is the fourth of
such origin reported after in utero exposure to phenytoin, suggesting that
phenytoin is a transplacental carcinogen. Infants of epileptic mothers receiving 
anticonvulsants should be closely examined at birth for the fetal hydantoin
syndrome and monitored for hemorrhagic problems. The neural crest tumor may be
found at birth or later in childhood.

Prediction of BCNU pulmonary toxicity in patients with malignant gliomas: an
assessment of risk factors.

Aronin PA, Mahaley MS Jr, Rudnick SA, Dudka L, Donohue JF, Selker RG, Moore P.

Symptomatic pulmonary disease occurred in 20 per cent of 93 patients with
anaplastic gliomas being treated with carmustine (BCNU). An analysis of the
variables has revealed a relation between the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity on
the one hand, and the total cumulative dose of BCNU, the number of cycles over
which the BCNU was administered, the history of lung disease, the patient's age, 
and the platelet-count nadir after the first course of BCNU on the other. An
equation has been generated that allows prediction of pulmonary toxicity during
the course of therapy with BCNU with 80 per cent accuracy. Pretreatment analysis 
of individual cases should allow safe use of BCNU and prevention of most of the
serious pulmonary complications caused by this drug.

Inborn error in the terminal step of aldosterone biosynthesis. Corticosterone
methyl oxidase tpe II deficiency in a North American pedigree.

Veldhuis JD, Kulin HE, Santen RJ, Wilson TE, Melby JC.

Profound salt wasting developed in a male infant who had marked reductions in
serum and urinary aldosterone concentrations despite striking hyperreninemia.
Coincident elevations in plasma and urinary levels of specific 18-hydroxysteroids
localized the defect to corticosterone methyl oxidase Type II, the adrenal enzyme
responsible for the final step of aldosterone synthesis. Salt replacement but not
hydrocortisone ameliorated the clinical and metabolic abnormalities. Evaluation
of 33 other family members disclosed the biochemical disorder in six other
subjects who were affected in an autosomal-recessive pattern with variably severe
clinical manifestations and abnormal ratios of 18-hydroxycorticosterone (or its
metabolites) to aldosterone. This inborn error in aldosterone biosynthesis must
be distinguished from other heritable, salt-losing defects in adrenal
steroidogenesis.

Loss of suppressor T cells in active multiple sclerosis. Analysis with monoclonal
antibodies.

Reinherz EL, Weiner HL, Hauser SL, Cohen JA, Distaso JA, Schlossman SF.

To determine whether abnormalities of immunoregulatory T cells are associated
with multiple sclerosis (MS), we characterized peripheral lymphocytes in 33
patients with untreated MS and compared them with 42 normal persons and 29
age-matched control subjects who had other neurologic diseases. For this
analysis, we used monoclonal antibodies to the surface antigens of helper (T4)
and suppressor (T5) T-cell subsets and to a common T-cell antigen (T3). In
contract to normal persons and the controls with other neurologic diseases, the
patients with MS had a reduced percentage of T3-positive (T3+) cells (P less than
0.05). More importantly, there was a selective decrease in T5-positive (T5+)
cells in 11 of 15 patients with active MS, but in only one of 18 patients with
inactive MS and in none of the normal persons or controls with neurologic disease
(P less than 0.00001). Serial analysis of five patients with MS showed a
correlation between the absence of the T5+ subset and disease activity. Thus,
there is loss of peripheral suppressor cells in many patients with active MS,
suggesting that immunoregulatory abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of 
the disease.

X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency.

Fleisher TA, White RM, Broder S, Nissley SP, Blaese RM, Mulvihill JJ, Olive G,
Waldmann TA.

We undertook clinical, immunologic, and endocrinologic studies of a family in
which two brothers and their two maternal uncles had a similar disorder
characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and isolated growth hormone deficiency.
Recurrent sinopulmonary infections were a prominent feature in two patients. All 
patients had short stature and retarded bone age during childhood, and the adults
had delayed onset of puberty. The immunodeficiency was characterized by absent
specific antibody production in vivo and impaired immunoglobulin production in
vitro. Three of the four patients lacked circulating B lymphocytes, even though
tonsils were present in those patients. All patients had deficient growth hormone
responses to insulin and arginine or levodopa. These patients have an X-linked
recessive disorder, but their immunodeficiency differs from the X-linked immune
disorders in the World Health Organization classification; their X-linked pattern
of growth hormone deficiency, without other endocrine abnormality, is also
unique.

Bone-marrow microenvironment defect in congenital hypoplastic anemia.

Ershler WB, Ross J, Finlay JL, Shahidi NT.

An abnormal bone-marrow microenvironment has been thought to have an important
role in the pathogenesis of aplastic and hypoplastic anemia in some patients, but
direct evidence of such a defect has not been found. We have investigated the
pathogenesis of chronic anemia in a young woman. Her bone-marrow cells, obtained 
by means of aspiration, showed exuberant erythroid growth in methylcellulose
despite marked erythroid hypoplasia. The erythroid nature of the colony growth
was further confirmed through measurement of heme synthesis and messenger
RNA-globin accumulation in a liquid-culture system. In contrast, when whole bone 
fragments were similarly cultured, no appreciable hemoglobin synthesis was
observed. The experimental evidence suggests that, in this patient, hypoplastic
anemia resulted from an unfavorable microenvironment.

An inherited abnormality of neutrophil adhesion. Its genetic transmission and its
association with a missing protein.

Crowley CA, Curnutte JT, Rosin RE, André-Schwartz J, Gallin JI, Klempner M,
Snyderman R, Southwick FS, Stossel TP, Babior BM.

Neutrophils from a five-year-old boy with recurrent bacterial infections failed
to spread on surfaces, leading to a severe defect in chemotaxis and a mild
impairment in phagocytosis. Failure to spread was also seen in a fraction of the 
neutrophils from the patient's mother and sister, but cells from his father and
brother were normal. Gel electrophoresis revealed that a protein with a molecular
weight of 110,000 daltons (designated gp 110) present in the particulate fraction
of normal neutrophils was absent from the patient's cells, and that its levels
were below normal in cells from his mother and sister but normal in neutrophils
from his father and brother. These findings suggest that gp 110 is necessary for 
the spreading of neutrophils onto surfaces, that the functional abnormality in
the patient's cells is caused by its absence, and that deficiency of gp 110 is an
X-linked congenital disease.

The threshold approach to clinical decision making.

Pauker SG, Kassirer JP.

The physician's estimate of the probability that a patient has a particular
disease is a principal factor in the determination of whether to withhold
treatment, obtain more data by testing, or treat without subjecting the patient
to the risks of further diagnostic tests. Using the concepts of decision
analysis, we have derived expressions for two threshold probabilities involved in
this choice: a "testing" threshold and a "test-treatment" threshold. Values can
be assigned to these thresholds from data on the reliability and potential risks 
of the diagnostic test and the benefits and risks of a specific treatment.
Treatment should be withheld if the probability of disease is smaller than the
testing threshold, and treatment should be given without further testing if the
probability of disease is greater than the test-treatment threshold. The test
should be performed (with treatment depending on the test outcome) only if the
probability of disease is between the two thresholds. The method exposes
important principles of decision making and helps the clinician develop a
rational, quantitative approach to the use of diagnostic tests.

Proliferation of T gamma cells with killer-cell activity in two patients with
neutropenia and recurrent infections.

Bom-van Noorloos AA, Pegels HG, van Oers RH, Silberbusch J, Feltkamp-Vroom TM,
Goudsmit R, Zeijlemaker WP, von dem Borne AE, Melief CJ.

Two patients with severe granulocytopenia and recurrent infections of the skin
and oropharynx had excess T lymphocytes with receptors for the Fc portion of IgG 
(T gamma cells) in blood and bone marrow. The abnormal T gamma cells killed
antibody-sensitized target cells in vitro (killer-cell activity) but did not
suppress immunoglobulin production by B lymphocytes (suppressor-cell activity). T
gamma lymphocytes from normal persons showed both killer-cell activity and
suppressor-cell activity. In the serum of one patient, granulocyte antibodies,
possibly of an autoimmune nature, were detected. The clinical picture in
conjunction with the hematologic and immunologic findings characterized the
disease of both patients as a distinct entity among the chronic
lymphoproliferative diseases of T-cell origin.

Splenectomy in the management of the thrombocytopenia of the Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome.

Lum LG, Tubergen DG, Corash L, Blaese RM.

The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked immunodeficiency disorder consisting 
of the triad of frequent infections, eczema, and profound thrombocytopenia. We
evaluated the effects of splenectomy on hemostatic improvement and subsequent
clinical course in 16 patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. All 16 had an
increase in platelet counts to at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter after
splenectomy, with the mean increasing from 19,900 per cubic millimeter
preoperatively to 262,700 per cubic millimeter after splenectomy. In addition,
platelet size, which is characteristically small in this disease, also became
normal. Survival after splenectomy correlated with the prophylactic use of
antibiotics. Five of seven patients not taking prophylactic antibiotics died of
sepis within 33 months of surgery. The mean survival of the nine patients
maintained with prophylactic antibiotics, however, was at least 91.4 months, with
six of these patients still alive an average of 11.0 years or more after
splenectomy. Thus, splenectomy is a useful therapy for a major cause of morbidity
and mortality in this complex syndrome.

Successful bone-marrow transplantation for infantile malignant osteopetrosis.

Coccia PF, Krivit W, Cervenka J, Clawson C, Kersey JH, Kim TH, Nesbit ME, Ramsay 
NK, Warkentin PI, Teitelbaum SL, Kahn AJ, Brown DM.

A five-month-old girl with autosomal-recessive osteopetrosis received a
bone-marrow transplant from her five-year-old HLA-MLC-identical brother after
preparation with cyclophosphamide and modified total-body irradiation.
Engraftment was documented by chromosomal analysis. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and
leukoerythroblastosis corrected within 12 weeks of transplantation. Low serum
calcium and elevated serum alkaline and acid phosphatase levels became normal.
Serial x-ray studies revealed bony remodeling and new nonsclerotic bone
formation. A pretransplantation bone biopsy revealed small marrow spaces, rare
marrow elements, increased osteoclasts, and no bony resorption. After
transplantation, osteoclasts were actively resorbing bone, and medullary cavities
contained normal bone marrow. Fluorescent Y-body analysis after transplantation
revealed donor (male) osteoclasts and recipient (female) osteoblasts. Monocyte
bactericidal activity, markedly decreased before transplantation, became normal. 
Vision, hearing, growth, and development were progressively improving 16 months
after transplantation. Allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation appears to be the
treatment of choice in this fatal disorder.

Cholera--a possible endemic focus in the United States.

Blake PA, Allegra DT, Snyder JD, Barrett TJ, McFarland L, Caraway CT, Feeley JC, 
Craig JP, Lee JV, Puhr ND, Feldman RA.

In September and October 1978, after a case of cholera had been discovered in
southwestern Louisiana, 10 more Vibrio cholerae O-Group 1 infections were
detected in four additional clusters. All 11 infected persons had recently eaten 
cooked crabs from five widely separated sites in the coastal marsh, and a
matched-triplet case-control study showed a significant relation between cholera 
and eating such crabs (P = 0.007). V. cholerae O1 was isolated from estuarine
water, from fresh shrimp, from a leftover cooked crab from a patient's
refrigerator, and from sewage in six towns, including three without identified
cases. All isolates in Louisiana and an isolate from a single unexplained case in
Texas in 1973 were biotype El Tor and serotype inaba; they were hemolytic and of 
a phage type unique to the United States--suggesting that the organism persisted 
undetected along the Gulf Coast for at least five years.

Diabetes due to secretion of an abnormal insulin.

Given BD, Mako ME, Tager HS, Baldwin D, Markese J, Rubenstein AH, Olefsky J,
Kobayashi M, Kolterman O, Poucher R.

A 51-year-old, nonobese man with diabetes mellitus had marked hyperinsulinemia
(70 to 120 muU per milliliter; 502 to 860 pmol per liter) and fasting
hyperglycemia (140 to 170 mg per 100 ml; 7.8 to 9.4 mmol per liter). Plasma
proinsulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and cortisol levels were normal; insulin
antibodies and insulin-receptor antibodies were not detected. The patient showed 
relatively normal insulin sensitivity, and insulin receptors on circulating
monocytes were within the normal range. Insulin from the patient's serum bound to
IM-9 lymphocytes and rat adipocytes approximately 40 per cent as well as insulin 
standards. Its biologic activity on rat adipocytes averaged 15 per cent of that
expected from its immunologic concentration. The impaired biologic activity of
this patient's circulating insulin was probably due to a structural abnormality. 
Subsequent studies of the patient's insulin (fortuitously obtained from his
pancreas during a laparotomy for a pancreatic cyst) have confirmed this
conclusion. (N Engl J Med 302:129-135, 1980).

The neurotoxicity of the rat poison vacor. A clinical study of 12 cases.

LeWitt PA.

Oral ingestion of a new rat poison that antagonizes nicotinamide metabolism,
N-3-pyridylmethyl-N'-p-nitrophenyl urea (PNU, Vacor), is known to cause diabetes 
mellitus. I describe neurologic complications of PNU ingestion in 12 patients 19 
to 50 years of age who swallowed between 0.39 and 7.02 g of PNU. One died within 
a day, and five died of chronic complications 40 to 182 days after taking the
poison. Apart from the acute hyperglycemic ketoacidosis, the clinical
presentation was variable, but orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal
hypomotility, peripheral neuropathy, and encephalopathy were typical. The
peripheral, autonomic, and central-nervous dysfunction could develop either
acutely or other several days. It is possible that nicotinamide, given
parenterally within minutes, prevents toxicity, but the cases discussed in this
paper indicate that the neurologic deficits may progress despite later
nicotinamide administration. Neurologic improvement took many months. Full
recovery was uncommon, and the orthostatic, hypotension tended to persist.

Recurrent hypoglycemia associated with glutaric aciduria type II in an adult.

Dusheiko G, Kew MC, Joffe BI, Lewin JR, Mantagos S, Tanaka K.

Repeated episodes of hypoglycemia accompanied by elevated serum concentrations of
free fatty acid without ketosis, fatty infiltration of the liver, hepatic
dysfunction, and proximal myopathy in a 19-year-old woman, prompted us to analyze
her urine for organic acids. Greatly increased quantities of glutaric acid,
ethylmalonic acid, dicarboxylic acids with six to 10 carbons, and
isovalerylglycine were consistently found in her urine. The ability of cultured
skin fibroblasts from the patient to oxidize [1(-14)C]butyrate and
[2(-14)C]lysine was reduced. These urinary and in vitro findings indicated
defective activity of several acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenases, including glutaryl,
isovaleryl, and butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenases -- establishing a diagnosis of 
glutaric aciduria Type II. Carnitine concentrations in the skeletal muscle and
liver were moderately reduced, but carnitine deficiency was considered a
secondary biochemical abnormality. Although glutaric aciduria Type II has
previously been described only in a neonate, the disease must be considered in
the differential diagnosis of hypoglycemia in adults.

Abnormal lymphocyte capping in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency
disease.

Gelfand EW, Oliver JM, Schuurman RK, Matheson DS, Dosch HM.

Despite the presence of normal numbers and distribution of T and B lymphocutes
and normal levels of serum immunoglobulins, a five-month-old infant failed to
show any evidence of T-cell or B-cell immunity. In trying to identify a specific 
membrane abnormality as a potential cause of the immunologic dysfunction, we
examined the lateral mobility of the cell-surface receptor for concanavalin A. In
contrast to normal cells, in which the receptor is distributed uniformly over the
cell surface, the patient's lymphocytes showed an unusually high accumulation of 
concanavalin A receptors in surface caps. This capping abnormality appeared in
both T and B lymphocytes and was exaggerated by colchicine, an inhibitor of
microtubule assembly. These findings support the theory that
plasma-membrane-cytoskeleton interactions have a role in the expression of
specific immunity; the findings also identify new areas that should be considered
in trying to understand the primary immunodeficiency diseases.

Neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Occurrence in a single
patient.

Fairchild RS, Kyner JL, Hermreck A, Schimke RN.

A 26-year-old woman had a neuroblastoma during infancy; an extra-adrenal
pheochromocytoma at age 16 years, with hepatic recurrences during the next ten
years; and multifocal renal cell carcinoma. Neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma,
despite their common embryologic origin, to our knowledge have not been
previously reported as separate tumors in the same patient. Although many
attributes of the patient's tumors suggest a hereditary disorder, thorough
investigation disclosed no evidence of heritable conditions associated with any
of these tumors in the patient or her family members. Long-term observation of
persons surviving after treatment of neuroblastoma will be necessary to determine
whether this case represents a previously unidentified tumor predisposition or a 
sporadic occurrence.

Abnormalities of immunoregulatory T cells in disorders of immune function.

Reinherz EL, Rubinstein A, Geha RS, Strelkauskas AJ, Rosen FS, Schlossman SF.

We studied a five-year-old girl with several autoimmune disorders and a
16-year-old boy with acquired agammaglobulinemia to determine whether aberrations
of immunoregulatory T cells could explain some instances of immunodeficiency or
autoimmunity. The normal peripheral blood T-cell population, as defined by
specific heteroantiserums, is 20 per cent TH2+ and 80 per cent TH2-. Human
suppressor cells are TH2+, whereas helper cells are TH2-. In addition, each
subset expresses Ia antigens upon activation. Our patient with autoimmune disease
had no demonstrable TH2+ cells, and her lymphocytes could not be induced to
suppress. Her circulating T cells were of an activated-helper phenotype, i.e.,
TH2-,Ia+. In contrast, in the boy with agammaglobulinemia, the T-cell population 
was predominantly of an activated-suppressor phenotype, i.e., TH2+,Ia+. This
patient's T cells abrogated both his own and his histoidentical brother's B-cell 
secretion of immunoglobulins. We conclude that the characterization of T cells
may provide insight into the causes of a number of abnormal immune states in man.

Protection of granulocytes by vitamin E in glutathione synthetase deficiency.

Boxer LA, Oliver JM, Spielberg SP, Allen JM, Schulman JD.

The administration of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) was found to improve
polymorphonuclear leukocyte function in an infant with congenital deficiency of
glutathione synthetase activity. Before therapy with vitamin E the abnormal
leukocytes exposed to phagocytic challenge showed oxidant damage. They released
60 per cent more hydrogen peroxide than did normal leukocytes, iodinated only 20 
to 25 per cent of the normal number of particles, and were unable to kill
bacteria as effectively as normal leukocytes although the rates of phagocytosis
were normal. These functional abnormalities disappeared when the patient was
placed on 400 IU of alpha-tocopherol daily for three months. Associated with the 
functional improvement was a normalization of microtubule assembly during
phagocytic challenge.

Human infection from an unidentified erythrocyte-associated bacterium.

Archer GL, Coleman PH, Cole RM, Duma RJ, Johnston CL Jr.

A 49-year-old splenectomized man had an infection from an unidentified,
gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that adhered to the majority of his
peripheral-blood erythrocytes. On transmission electron microscopy, the bacterium
was seen to be extra-erythrocytic and was 0.2 micrometer wide by 1.0 to 1.7
micrometer long. It possessed a thick, granular cell wall, a trilamellar membrane
external to the cell wall and prominent mesosomes. Attempts to cultivate the
organism in vitro or to duplicate the patient's disease in splenectomized animals
were unsuccessful. The patient's response suggested that the bacterium was
susceptible to cell-wall-active antibiotics and to chloramphenicol but not to
tetracycline. This bacterium may be the cause of other chronic, fever-producing, 
multisystem diseases of unknown origin.

The use of in vitro technics to study drug-induced pancytopenia.

Kelton JG, Huang AT, Mold N, Logue G, Rosse WF.

The confirmation of drug-induced marrow aplasia is difficult since rechallenging 
the patient can lead to serious morbidity. We used marrow-culture technics to
challenge in vitro the bone marrow of a patient with marrow aplasia after
ingestion of quinidine. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of
quinidine-mediated destruction of erythrocytes, leukocytes or platelets. By
contrast, use of quinidine in combination with the patient's serum substantially 
inhibited in vitro growth of allogeneic marrow granulocytic and erythroid series.
Furthermore, use of quinidine in combination with acute-phase serum (but not
acute-phase serum alone or quinidine in combination with recovery-phase serum)
inhibited growth of the patient's marrow. This observation suggests that both a
transient serum factor and quinidine were responsible for the marrow aplasia.
These technics could be applied with minimal risk to similar patients and would
permit in vitro rechallenge with the suspected drug.

Somatostatinoma syndrome. Biochemical, morphologic and clinical features.

Krejs GJ, Orci L, Conlon JM, Ravazzola M, Davis GR, Raskin P, Collins SM,
McCarthy DM, Baetens D, Rubenstein A, Aldor TA, Unger RH.

Diabetes mellitus, steatorrhea, cholelithiasis and a tumor distorting the
duodenum prompted a work-up for somatostatinoma in a 52-year-old man. The
responses of pancreatic B-cells but not of A-cells to nutrient stimuli were
inhibited, and growth-hormone release was suppressed, suggesting somatostatin
resistance in some target tissues. Plasma somatostatin-like immunoreactivity
ranged from 9000 to 13,000 pg per milliliter (normal: 88+/-8, mean +/- S.E.M.)
and was distributed in four molecular forms, including free somatostatin. The
primary tumor contained 5 microgram of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity per
milligram of wet tissue, distributed in three of the molecular forms noted in
plasma. Plasma calcitonin was also elevated (4650 pg per milliliter; normal: less
than 120). Immunocytochemical studies showed that cells of the primary tumor
contained somatostatin and calcitonin but no other peptide hormones. Only
somatostatin was present in the metastases. Somatostatin was localized electron
microscopically in all secretory granules, irrespective of size and shape,
whereas calcitonin was present only within a single subpopulation of small
granules in the same cells.

Clinical research in general medical journals: a 30-year perspective.

Fletcher RH, Fletcher SW.

Little is known about the frequency with which various research designs appear in
the clinical literature and how this frequency has changed in recent years. This 
study describes the research designs used in 612 articles randomly selected from 
original research published in three general medical journals from 1946 to 1976. 
Cross-sectional studies increased from 25 to 44 per cent, cohort studies declined
from 59 to 34 per cent, and clinical trials increased from 13 to 21 per cent of
articles (P less than 0.001). Randomized controlled trials comprised 5 per cent
of articles published in 1976 and were not represented 30 years before. In 1976, 
37 per cent of articles reported on 10 subjects or less, and this number has not 
changed substantially since 1946. The frequency of studies with weak research
designs has increased in these general medical journals over the past 30 years.
The trend deserves critical attention.

Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia: expression in cells restricted to granulocytic and
monocytic differentiation.

Fialkow PJ, Singer JW, Adamson JW, Berkow RL, Friedman JM, Jacobson RJ, Moohr JW.

Two patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia who were heterozygous for the
X-chromosome-linked enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were studied to
determine the number and type of cells in which the disease arises. Both type A
and B isoenzymes were found in normal tissues, but the myeloblasts showed only
one enzyme type, indicating that at the time of study, the disease had a clonal
origin. The observation in one patient that erythroid cells did not arise from
this clone contrasts with conclusions reached in patients previously studied with
chromosomal markers. The results suggest that in this patient, the leukemic clone
suppressed expression of normal granulopoiesis but did not inhibit erythroid
differentiation from normal progenitors. They suggest also that the disease is
heterogeneous. In some patients, the disease is expressed in cells with
differentiation restricted to the granulocyte-macrophage pathway; in others, it
involves stem cells that also differentiate into erythrocytes. This heterogeneity
may reflect differences in causation and could have prognostic importance.

Isolation of a virus from the pancreas of a child with diabetic ketoacidosis.

Yoon JW, Austin M, Onodera T, Notkins AL.

A healthy 10-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital in diabetic ketoacidosis
within three days of onset of symptoms of a flu-like illness. He died seven days 
later and post-mortem examination showed lymphocytic infiltration of the islets
of Langerhans and necrosis of beta cells. Inoculation of mouse, monkey and human 
cell cultures with homogenates from the patient's pancreas led to isolation of a 
virus. Serologic studies revealed a rise in the titer of neutralizing antibody to
this virus from less than 4 on the second hospital day to 32 on the day of death.
Neutralization data showed that the virus was related to a diabetogenic variant
derived from Coxsackievirus B4. Inoculation of mice with the human isolate
produced hyperglycemia, inflammatory cells in the islets of Langerhans and
beta-cell necrosis. Staining of mouse pancreatic sections with
fluorescein-labeled antiviral antibody revealed viral antigens in beta cells.
Both the clinical picture and animal studies suggested that the patient's
diabetes was virus induced.

Immune response of a patient with deficiency of the fourth component of
complement and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Jackson CG, Ochs HD, Wedgwood RJ.

The clinical details of a five-year-old boy with systemic lupus erythematosus and
an inherited deficiency of the fourth component of complement (C4) have been
reported elsewhere. In this study of his immune responses, immunization with
bacteriophage phi X 174 demonstrated diminished antibody formation, abnormal
immunologic memory and failure to switch from IgM to IgG during secondary
response. We also noted persistent lymphopenia and reductions in peripheral-blood
T lymphocytes, lymphocyte responses to mitogens and allogeneic cells and
granulocyte chemotaxis. Kinetic studies revealed that delayed activation of the
alternative pathway was corrected by purified C4 only if the classical pathway
was not blocked. This finding is consistent with the concept that minute amounts 
of C3b provided through the classical pathway are necessary to prime the
properdin system. Inability to activate the classical complement pathway,
abnormal kinetics of alternative-pathway activation and depressed antibody
responses to a T-cell-dependent antigen may predispose C4-deficient patients to
viral infection or immune-complex formation.

Defective initiation of oxidative metabolism in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Harvath L, Andersen BR.

The polymorphonuclear leukocytes of a two-year-old boy who had multiple episodes 
of bacterial infections demonstrated defective oxidative metabolism with
phagocytic, but not with soluble (non-phagocytic), metabolic stimuli. We used a
chemiluminescence assay to examine the patient's polymorphonuclear leukocyte
responses to numerous particulate and soluble stimuli. The patient's
polymorphonuclear leukocytes had substantially depressed chemiluminescent
responses during phagocytosis of opsonized particles (latex, pneumococci,
pseudomonas, streptococci and zymosan); however, we observed normal
chemiluminescent responses when these leukocytes were stimulated with soluble
agents (sodium fluoride, concanavalin A, cytochalasin E, calcium ionophore A23187
or phorbol myristate acetate). Polymorphonuclear leukocyte oxygen consumption and
superoxide production were impaired during phagocytosis, even though phagocytosis
was normal. In addition to the metabolic defect, this patient's polymorphonuclear
leukocytes had depressed chemotactic and bactericidal activities. This study
provides evidence that polymorphonuclear leukocytes have more than one mechanism 
for initiating oxidative metabolism.

Free "small" and IgG-associated "large" hepatitis B e antigen in the serum and
glomerular capillary walls of two patients with membranous glomerulonephritis.

Takekoshi Y, Tanaka M, Miyakawa Y, Yoshizawa H, Takahashi K, Mayumi M.

Nephrotic syndrome developed in two children who carried hepatitis B virus. Both 
their serums contained hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg). Two physicochemically and immunologically different categories of HBeAg 
activity were identified in their serums--i.e., small molecular (free) and large 
molecular (associated with IgG). Their kidney-biopsy specimens disclosed
pathologic changes typical of membranous glomerulonephritis. By a
fluorescent-antibody technic, HBeAg was found to be deposited in diffuse granular
fashion, along glomerular capillary walls together with IgG and beta1C, but no
deposition of hepatitis B surface antigen was detected. The presence of HBeAg in 
association with IgG both in the serum and in the kidneys of these patients
suggests that HBeAg caused membranous glomerulonephritis by inducing the
formation and deposition of immune complexes.

H-Y antigen mosaicism in the gonad of a 46,XX true hermaphrodite.

Winters SJ, Wachtel SS, White BJ, Koo GC, Javadpour N, Loriaux DL, Sherins RJ.

To clarify the mechanism for the coexistence of ovarian and testicular tissue in 
the 46,XX true hermaphrodite, we studied a 20-year-old phenotypic male with
gynecomastia and elevated serum concentrations of estradiol in whom an ovotestis 
was discovered upon scrotal exploration. Y chromosomal material could not be
detected by fluorescent Y-body analysis or Giemsa-banding technics in cells
cultured from peripheral blood, breast or forearm skin or the ovarian or
testicular portions of the ovotestis. However, serologic testing, using the sperm
cytotoxicity assay, revealed that cells cultured from the testicular portion of
the ovotestis were H-Y antigen positive whereas cells cultured from the ovarian
portion were H-Y antigen negative. These observations indicate that the ovotestis
arises from an H-Y+/H-Y- mosaic primordium.

Helper and suppressor t-lymphocyte leukemia in ataxia telangiectasia.

Saxon A, Stevens RH, Golde DW.

We investigated the nature of the lymphoid leukemia that developed in one of two 
siblings with ataxia telangiectasia. The leukemic cells were shown to be T
lymphocytes. Furthermore, the neoplastic cells carried a characteristic 14q+
chromosome tandem translocation. This chromosome abnormality had been identified 
11 years earlier among the patient's "normal" lymphocytes. The patient's
neoplastic T lymphocytes in vitro provided helper and suppressor T-lymphocyte
activity equivalent to that of normal T lymphocytes. Some neoplastic T
lymphocytes bore a receptor for the Fc portion of IgM (45 per cent Tmu) whereas
other carried receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (10 per cent Tgamma). All the
Tmu and Tgamma lymphocytes possessed the chromosome 14 abnormality. These data
suggest that neoplastic transformation occurred in an uncommitted T lymphocyte
that was capable of further differentiation into the distinct pathways for help
and suppression, in a lymphoid analogy of chronic myelogenous leukemia.

In vivo and in vitro effects of thymosin and adenosine deaminase on
adenosine-deaminase-deficient lymphocytes.

Rubinstein A, Hirschhorn R, Sicklick M, Murphy RA.

Two siblings with adenosine deaminase deficiency were studied before and during
"enzyme replacement" therapy (partial exchange transfusions with normal red cells
containing the missing enzyme). The younger sib showed improvement of immunologic
function during red-cell therapy alone, whereas in the older sib this improvement
occurred only when the transfusions were supplemented by thymosin injections.
Their clinical courses correlated with in vitro findings: lymphocytes from the
younger sib differentiated to T-cell-rosette-forming cells upon addition of
adenosine deaminase alone; lymphocytes from the older sibling required
supplemental thymosin to form these cells. Thymic factors appear to influence the
response to transfusion therapy in some patients deficient in adenosine
deaminase, and supplementation of red-cell transfusion with thymic factors may be
required.

Disappearance of Ph1-positive cells in four patients with chronic granulocytic
leukemia after chemotherapy, irradiation and marrow transplantation from an
identical twin.

Fefer A, Cheever MA, Thomas ED, Boyd C, Ramberg R, Glucksberg H, Buckner CD,
Storb R.

Four patients (21, 41, 13 and 38 years of age) with a history of chronic
granulocytic leukemia for 12, 10, 11, and 106 months, respectively, were treated 
with dimethyl busulfan, cyclophosphamide, 920 rads of total-body irradiation and 
intravenous marrow infusion from normal, genetically identical twins. Serial
chromosome analyses were performed on marrow aspirates cultured without mitotic
stimulants. No Ph1-positive cells were detected in the marrows from the normal
twins, whereas just before therapy, all 100 metaphases examined from each patient
were Ph1-positive. Chromosome analyses were performed three to five times per
patient after transplantation, and not a single Ph1-positive cell was detected.
The patients remain hematologically normal 22, 23, 26 and 31 months after
transplantation. The results show that the Ph1-positive clone can be eradicated
by vigorous therapy and that the marrow in chronic granulocytic leukemia can be
repopulated by stem cells from normal twins.

Androgen insensitivity as a cause of infertility in otherwise normal men.

Aiman J, Griffin JE, Gazak JM, Wilson JD, MacDonald PC.

To ascertain if androgen insensitivity causes severe oligospermia or azoospermia 
we studied three unrelated, phenotypically normal men with long histories of
infertility. The mean plasma concentrations and production rates of testosterone 
were 14.3 ng per milliliter and 10.1 mg per day, respectively, values
approximately twice the average found in normal men. Serum luteinizing hormone
concentrations were elevated in two of the three subjects. The specific
high-affinity dihydrotestosterone binding capacity of cultured genital-skin
fibroblasts was 8, 0 and 10 fmol per milligram of cellular protein, values half
(or less) of those from normal men and women but similar to values in subjects
with partial androgen insensitivity manifested by incomplete testicular
feminization or Reifenstein syndrome. The low amount of androgen receptor and the
combination of high serum gonadotropins and plasma testosterone production rates 
suggest that the defective spermatogenesis in these infertile men was the
consequence of androgen insensitivity.

Transient hyperammonemia of the preterm infant.

Ballard RA, Vinocur B, Reynolds JW, Wennberg RP, Merritt A, Sweetman L, Nyhan WL.

We report on five preterm infants (34 to 36 weeks' gestation) in whom an
overwhelming illness developed within the first 48 hours of life. Each had mild
respiratory distress that progressed within 48 hours to deep coma requiring
ventilatory assistance. Ammonia concentrations in the plasma ranged from 844 to
7640 microgram per deciliter. Four received exchange transfusion and peritoneal
dialysis; ammonia values returned to the normal range (less than 150 mug per
deciliter) within 72 hours and remained there even after protein challenge. These
four subsequently fed and developed normally. The fifth infant died without an
attempt to lower plasma ammonia. In this infant (and two of the others)
urea-cycle enzymes measured in liver tissue were in the normal range. Transient
hyperammonemia of unknown cause may be a relatively common variety of neonatal
hyperammonemia; it responds well to prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy.

Prolactin-screening tumors and hypogonadism in 22 men.

Carter JN, Tyson JE, Tolis G, Van Vliet S, Faiman C, Friesen HG.

We studied 22 men with prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors and hypogonadism.
Twenty complained of impotence, nine had visual impairment, and three experienced
galactorrhea. None of the 17 patients undergoing operation or radiotherapy, or
both, were subsequently normoprolactinemic. In all 13 patients treated with
bromocryptine major clinical improvement was associated with a decrease in serum 
prolactin levels and in nine with an increase in serum testosterone. Two patients
receiving testosterone replacement therapy showed improved potency only after
bromocryptine was administered. The results indicate that hyperprolactinemia
frequently induces hypogonadism in men, that bromocryptine ameliorates symptoms
of disease previously unchanged by operation or radiotherapy, and that the
impotence observed may not be solely the result of hypogonadism.

Cobalamin analogues are present in human plasma and can mask cobalamin deficiency
because current radioisotope dilution assays are not specific for true cobalamin.

Kolhouse JF, Kondo H, Allen NC, Podell E, Allen RH.

Since R protein binds cobalamin (vitamin B12) and cobalamin analogues, whereas
intrinsic factor is highly specific for true cobalamin, we compared the serum
cobalamin values obtained with these proteins in radioisotope dilution assays.
With R protein, eight of 21 patients with cobalamin deficiency had serum
cobalamin levels (mean, 204, range, 85 to 355 pg per milliliter) that overlapped 
with values for 74 normal subjects (mean, 576, range, 220 to 1230). With
intrinsic factor, no patient values (mean, 36, range, less than 10 to 78 pg per
milliliter) overlapped with the normal values (mean, 322, range, 130 to 785).
Paper chromatography showed that these differences were due to the presence of
cobalamin analogues. R protein constituted 51 to 85 per cent of the
cobalamin-binding protein in 10 commercial serum cobalamin assay kits, which were
said to contain "intrinsic factor". Human plasma contains cobalamin analogues
that can mask cobalamin deficiency with current radioisotope dilution assays.

Hyperphenylalaninemia due to a deficiency of biopterin. A variant form of
phenylketonuria.

Kaufman S, Berlow S, Summer GK, Milstien S, Schulman JD, Orloff S, Spielberg S,
Pueschel S.

We studied the components of the hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylating system in a 
child with phenylketonuria who showed substantial neurologic impairment despite
early dietary control of elevated blood phenylalanine levels. Phenylalanine
hydroxylase, dihydropteridine reductase and dihydrofolate reductase activities
were normal. In contrast the level of hydroxylation cofactor,
tetrahydrobiopterin, in liver was only 10 per cent of normal. In addition to this
hepatic deficiency, serum and urinary levels of biopterin-like compounds were
low, and the serum biopterin did not increase in response to a phenylalanine load
as it does in normal and phenylketonuric subjects. The phenylalanine hydroxylase 
activity in this child, as determined by an in vivo tritium-release assay, was
2.3 per cent of the normal value. These results indicate that the child suffers
from a variant form of phenylketonuria--a deficiency of a functional
phenylalanine hydroxylating system secondary to a defect in biosynthesis of
biopterin.

Tangier disease: one explanation of lipid storage.

Herbert PN, Forte T, Heinen RJ, Fredrickson DS.

Normal high-density lipoproteins are absent from plasma in Tangier disease, and
the disorder is characterized by accumulation of cholesteryl esters in several
tissues, particularly those of the reticuloendothelial system. Electron
microscopy of the abnormal high-density lipoproteins in the plasma of three
patients with Tangier diseases revealed large (68-nm), flattened, translucent
particles in all cases. These particles were most abundant in the plasma of the
splenectomized patient. Restriction of dietary fat eliminated or drastically
reduced the numbers of these particles among the Tangier high-density
lipoproteins. Thus abnormal products of chylomicron metabolism that appear to
occur in plasma in this disorder may be targets for phagocytosis and may be at
least one source of the cholesteryl esters that accumulate in reticuloendothelial
tissues in Tangier disease.

The social and economic cost of end-stage renal disease. A patient's perspective.

Campbell JD, Campbell AR.

The soical and economic effects of end-stage renal disease are enormous. This
case history of our experience with dialysis and transplantation details our life
with these two modes of treatment. Despite the common notion that Medicare covers
most of the expenses, the detailed records of our financial experience show that 
Medicare paid only 53 per cent of our total costs; the remainder came from a
mixture of private and public sources. In seeking alternative financial support, 
we encountered many problems, including complex and constraining requirements for
aid, invasion of privacy, high insurance and bank-interest rates and termination 
of employment. Even those in middle-income brackets find it difficult to maintain
their independence under such circumstances. New legislation extending Medicare
coverage of home dialysis and transplantation should help to alleviate these
problems in the future.

A syndrome of methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, megaloblastic anemia and
neurologic abnormalities in a vitamin B12-deficient breast-fed infant of a strict
vegetarian.

Higginbottom MC, Sweetman L, Nyhan WL.

We studied a six-month-old infant with severe megaloblastic anemia, coma and
hyperpigmentation of the extremities. He was found to have methylmalonic aciduria
(79 mumol per milligram of creatinine) and homocystinuria (0.85 mumol per
milligram of creatinine). Additional biochemical abnormalities included
cystathioninuria, glycinuria, methylcitric aciduria, 3-hydroxypropionic aciduria 
and formic aciduria. The concentration of vitamin B12 in the serum was 20 pg per 
milliliter. This severe nutritional deficiency was a consequence of inadequate
intake, for the infant was exclusively breast-fed by a strictly vegetarian mother
who manifested methylmalonic aciduria. Our observations emphasize the importance 
of educating strict vegetarians about the deficiency of vitamin B12 in their
diets and the importance of vitamin B12 supplementation.

Hypertriglyceridemia associated with deficiency of apolipoprotein C-II.

Breckenridge WC, Little JA, Steiner G, Chow A, Poapst M.

A 59-year-old man with severe hypertriglyceridemia and no post-heparin lipolytic 
activity was studied because of a marked fall in plasma triglyceride
concentrations after a blood transfusion. An apolipoprotein activator
(apolipoprotein C-II) for lipoprotein lipase could not be detected by
polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of apoproteins, immunodiffusion of the plasma 
against anti-apolipoprotein CII or activation assays for lipoprotein lipase.
Furthermore, the patient's triglyceride-rich lipoproteins would not serve as
substrate for lipoprotein lipase. The patient had latent post-heparin lipolytic
activity, which appeared after the addition of apolipoprotein CII to the
post-heparin plasma. After a transfusion of 1 unit of plasma from a normal
subject the patient's plasma triglycerides fell, within one day, from 1000 to 250
mg per deciliter and remained below preinfusion concentrations for six days. We
conclude that this patient's hyperlipoproteinemia resulted from a deficiency of
apolipoprotein C-II.

Extreme insulin resistance in ataxia telangiectasia: defect in affinity of
insulin receptors.

Bar RS, Levis WR, Rechler MM, Harrison LC, Siebert C, Podskalny J, Roth J, Muggeo
M.

The syndrome of ataxia telangiectasia is associated with glucose intolerance and 
insulin resistance. We examined the status of insulin receptors on circulating
monocytes and on cultured fibroblasts from two siblings with ataxia
telangiectasia and severe insulin resistance. 125I-insulin binding to monocytes
of the two patients consistently demonstrated an 80 to 85 per cent decrease in
receptor affinity. In contrast, the defect in receptor affinity was not expressed
on the patients' cultured fibroblasts or on monocytes or fibroblasts obtained
from unaffected family members. Whole plasma and immunoglobulin-enriched
fractions of plasma from the patients inhibited the normal binding of insulin to 
its receptors on cultured human lymphocytes (IM -9 line) and on human placental
membranes. We conclude that the insulin resistance in the two siblings with
ataxia telangiectasia was associated with defects in the affinity of the
receptors for insulin, probably caused by circulating inhibitors of insulin
binding.

The Passovoy defect: further characterization of a hereditary hemorrhagic
diathesis.

Hougie C, Mc Pherson RA, Brown JE, Lakin-Thomas PL, Melaragno A, Aronson L, Baugh
RF.

We studied a coagulation abnormality present in 12 members of five kindreds who
bruised easily and bled excessively after minor trauma. Their activated partial
thromboplastin times were between 32 and 39 seconds (normal, 22.8 to 28.8
seconds). Prothrombin times, thrombin times, platelet-function tests and the
levels of factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, prekallikrein and high-molecular-weight
kininogen were normal. Within these kindreds inheritance of prolonged partial
thromboplastin times followed an autosomal and probably dominant pattern. The
prolonged thromboplastin times were corrected by normal plasma and by normal
plasma adsorbed with celite, but there was no mutual correction between plasmas
of the patients. These subjects shared a common defect in the intrinsic pathway
of coagulation that we designate by the proband's surname, Passovoy.

Acquired von Willebrand's disease. Evidence for a quantitative and qualitative
factor VIII disorder.

Joist JH, Cowan JF, Zimmerman TS.

To define further the factor VIII abnormality in acquired von Willebrand's
disease, we performed immunoelectrophoresis of factor VIII antigen, as well as
quantitative measurements of the antigen, factor VIII procoagulant activity and
von Willebrand factor activity on plasma from an affected 57-year-old man who
also had a poorly differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma. No evidence for an
inhibitor against factor VIII procoagulant activity or von Willebrand factor
activity was detected, but immunoelectrophoresis showed none of the less anodic
forms of factor VIII antigen. There were concomitant decreases in total antigen
(0.19 U per milliliter) and von Willebrand factor levels (0.12 U per milliliter).
Factor VIII-procoagulant activity was borderline low (0.45 U per milliliter).
Correction of both the abnormal immunoelectrophoresis pattern and the
quantitative abnormalities followed radiotherapy of the lymphoma. The factor VIII
abnormalities might have resulted from binding or destruction of theless anodic
forms of factor VIII antigen by the malignant lymphocytes.

Vitamin-D-dependent rickets type II. Resistance of target organs to
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Brooks MH, Bell NH, Love L, Stern PH, Orfei E, Queener SF, Hamstra AJ, DeLuca HF.

Studies were done to determine the cause for hypocalcemia, secondary
hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia and osteitis fibrosa cystica in a 22-year-old
black woman. The patient had normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (14 ng per
milliliter) and markedly elevated serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (137 pg per
milliliter). Vitamin D3, 4000 units per day for four weeks, increased the serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D to as high as 29 and 297 pg per
milliliter, respectively, and corrected the hypocalcemia and secondary
hyperparathyroidism. The results suggest that the disorder results from impaired 
end-organ response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. We propose that the entity be
called vitamin-D-dependent rickets Type II.

Complete correction of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome by allogeneic bone-marrow
transplantation.

Parkman R, Rappeport J, Geha R, Belli J, Cassady R, Levey R, Nathan DG, Rosen FS.

Two patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome had complete donor lymphoid and
hematopoietic engraftment after successful allogeneic bone-marrow
transplantation. One patient had had only a temporary donor T-lymphocyte graft
after a previous transplantation, for which he had been prepared with cytarabine 
and cyclophosphamide; the patient's own T lymphocytes returned six months later. 
A repeat transplant, for which the patient was prepared with anti-human thymocyte
serum, total-body irradiation and procarbazine, resulted in complete donor
engraftment. The second patient underwent a successful transplantation after
similar preparation, except that procarbazine was omitted. At 11 and five months 
after transplantation both had normal hematopoiesis and no evidence of
graft-versus-host disease. This treatment of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome may be 
a model for the correction of other genetically determined immune and hematologic
bone-marrow disorders.

Familial hypopituitarism with large sella turcica.

Parks JS, Tenore A, Bongiovanni AM, Kirkland RT.

We studied endocrine function in three siblings with short stature and
enlargement of the sella turcica. Sellar volumes were 5.9, 3.7 and 4.0 standard
deviations above age-specific means. Computed tomography or pneumoencephalography
showed full sellae without suprasellar extension. Basal thyrotropin levels were
low despite hypothyroidism and increments were less than 3 micromicron per
milliliter after thyrotropin-releasing hormone injection. Stimulated growth
hormone levels were less than 5 ng per milliliter, declining to less than 2 ng
per milliliter after thyroxine treatment. Both thyroxine and growth hormone
treatments were required for rapid growth. Impaired thyrotropin responses to
thyrotropin-releasing hormone distinguish these patients from most cases of
idiopathic or familial deficiency of thyrotropin and growth hormone. Persistent
deficiency of growth hormone during thyroxine treatment indicates that the
defects is not limited to thyrotropin structure or release. The findings are
compatible with either familial neoplasia of the anterior pituitary or a
regulatory defect promoting anterior pituitary-cell hyperplasia and inhibiting
thyrotropin and growth hormone release.

Immunocytochemical identification of azurophilic and specific granule markers in 
the giant granules of Chediak-Higashi neutrophils.

Rausch PG, Pryzwansky KB, Spitznagel JK.

We used immunofluorescent microscopy to characterize the abnormal granules in
neutrophils from five patients with Chediak-Higashi disease. Monospecific
antiserums to the azurophilic markers myeloperoxidase, elastase, cathepsin G and 
lysozyme, and to the specific granule markers lactoferrin and lysozyme, were
labeled with fluorescein and rhodamine and were used to demonstrate two antigens 
in the same cell simultaneously. The abnormal granules in Chediak-Higashi
neutrophils contained both azurophilic and specific granule markers.
Normal-appearing lactoferrin-positive granules were also present, but normal
azurophilic granules were not seen. Analysis of bone-marrow samples from two of
these patients suggested that the abnormal granules were formed during
granulocyte maturation by the progressive aggregation and fusion of normally
formed azurophilic and specific granules. These results are consistent with a
membrane abnormality or a defect of microtubular function leading to
inappropriate granule fusion, and suggest that the granular abnormality is more
generalized than previously appreciated.

Folate-induced remission in aplastic anemia with familial defect of cellular
folate uptake.

Branda RF, Moldow CF, MacArthur JR, Wintrobe MM, Anthony BK, Jacob HS.

Severe aplastic anemia developed in a young man with an extensive family history 
of leukemia, pancytopenia, and neutropenia. Megaloblastic changes became evident,
and treatment with high doses of folic acid resulted in striking clinical
improvement. However, red-cell folate levels remained persistently low despite
high serum folate levels. A defect in cellular folate uptake was suspected, and, 
indeed, uptake of 5-14CH3-H4-folate by stimulated lymphocytes and by bone-marrow 
cells from the patient was significantly reduced (P less than 0.05 as compared to
normal cells. Further characterization of folate metabolism showed that
intestinal absorption of the vitamin, membrane transport of 5-14CH3-H4-folate by 
mature red cells, folate utilization in the conversion of deoxyuridylate to
thymidylate and polyglutamate formation were all normal. At least five other
family members manifest decreased uptake of 5-14CH3-H4-folate by stimulated
lymphocytes. These studies suggest that a genetically induced abnormality of
folate uptake contributed to this patient's severe, but reversible, aplasia.

Porphyria cutanea tarda in three generations of a single family.

Benedetto AV, Kushner JP, Taylor JS.

We examined conjugal and blood relatives of one kindred for evidence of porphyria
cutanea tarda. The disease was identified in eight family members in three
generations. Four were classified as having overt porphyria cutanea tarda because
of four criteria: photo-enhanced dermatosis; excessive urinary excretion of
uroporphyrins; characteristic thin-layer chromatographic pattern of urinary
porphyrins; and decreased activity of erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.
Two patients with excessive excretion of uroporphyrins or characteristic
chromatograms, or both, and decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity
were classified as having subclinical porphyria cutanea tarda, and two with
decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity only were classified as having 
latent porphyria cutanea tarda. This study provides further evidence that
prophyria cutanea tarda can be a familial disease inherited in an autosomal
dominant fashion. We propose a reclassification of porphria cutanea tarda as an
overt, subclinical or latent disorder.

Correction of human cyclic neutropenia with prednisolone.

Wright DG, Fauci AS, Dale DC, Wolff SM.

A 70-year-old woman with cyclic neutropenia was treated with 16 mg of
etiocholanolone and 25 mg of prednisolone intramuscularly every other day. During
14 weeks' treatment amplitude of cyclic fluctuations in neutrophil counts
gradually decreased, but pretreatment cycles returned promptly after treatment
was stopped. Prednisolone alone every other day (25 mg) reproduced this result,
and by 23 weeks, neutrophil counts became stable at about 1500 per cubic
millimeter. tcycling of monocytes, platelets and reticulocytes was also
eliminated, as were symptoms that had accompanied neutropenic periods. In
addition, bone-marrow neutrophil precursors and neutrophil marrow reserves were
stabilized. The patient was subsequently maintained satisfactorily with oral
prednisolone, 20 mg every other day. These studies demonstrate that the
discontinuous myeloid maturation that occurs in cyclic neutropenia can be
corrected with prednisolone every other day.

Familial azotemia. Impaired urea excretion despite normal renal function.

Hsu CH, Kurtz TW, Massari PU, Ponze SA, Chang BS.

We performed detailed studies of renal function in two of five related patients
with normal serum creatinine levels to determine the mechanism of their chronic
azotemia. Inulin and para-amino-hippurate clearances, maximum tubular transport
of para-aminohippurate, and renal acidification were within normal limits. In
addition, renal concentrating and diluting abilities of these patients were
similar to those of four normal controls. Urea clearances of both patients during
maximum water diuresis (27.6 and 40.8 ml per minute per 1.73 m2) and antidiuresis
(5.3 and 4.0), however, were much lower than mean (+/- S.E.M.) values in the
normal controls (70.4 +/- 3.7 and 30.0 +/- 3.42 ml per minute per 1.73 m2,
respectively). Thus decreased urea excretion despite otherwise normal renal
function was responsible for the chronic azotemia of these patients. The genetic 
defect in renal urea clearance appeared to be inherited as an autosomal dominant 
trait.

Characterization of a suppressor-cell leukemia. Evidence for the requirement of
an interaction of two T cells in the development of human suppressor effector
cells.

Broder S, Poplack D, Whang-Peng J, Durm M, Goldman C, Muul L, Waldmann TA.

To characterize the suppressor activity of neoplastic T cells from a child with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia and hypogammaglobulinemia, we applied an in vitro
assay that determines the capacity of pokeweed-mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes to 
mature into immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The geometric mean synthesis by
peripheral blood lymphocytes from 12 normal persons was 3200 ng for IgM, 2447 ng 
for IgG and 1825 for IgA (2 X 10(6) cells per 12 days in culture). The patient's 
leukemic cells produced no detectable immunoglobulin and depressed the
immunoglobulin production of normal lymphocytes by 85 to 100 per cent in
co-culture experiments. However, suppression was observed only when co-operating 
normal T cells were present. Prior irradiation of either the leukemic T cells or 
the co-operating normal T cells nullified the suppressor effect. Therefore, an
interaction between at least two different T-cell subsets may be required for the
generation of suppressor effector T cells in man.

Cellular distribution of hemoglobin F in a clonal hemopoietic stem-cell disorder.

Papayannopoulou T, Bunn HF, Stamatoyannopoulos G.

Because all erythroid cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia are believed to arise
from a common pluripotent stem cell, we studied the cellular distribution of
fetal hemoglobin in patients with the disease to test whether cells with and
without hemoglobin F have a common or separate pluripotent stem-cell origin. In a
patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia and sickle/beta thalassemia, 17 per
cent of the red cells during remission and 18 to 22 per cent during the blastic
phase contained fetal hemoglobin. In 24 non-hemoglobinopathic leukemic patients
0.3 to 28 per cent of red cells contained hemoglobin F. Since the erythrocytes in
chronic myelogenous leukemia are almost exclusively derived from the malignant
clone, these data suggest that cells containing fetal hemoglobin originate from
the same pluripotent stem-cell progenitor as those without hemoglobin F. The
findings argue against a separate line of "partially switched" pluripotent stem
cells as being responsible for maintenance of hemoglobin F production in the
adult.

Malakoplakia: evidence for monocyte lysosomal abnormality correctable by
cholinergic agonist in vitro and in vivo.

Abdou NI, NaPombejara C, Sagawa A, Ragland C, Stechschulte DJ, Nilsson U, Gourley
W, Watanabe I, Lindsey NJ, Allen MS.

We studied monocyte function in a case of malakoplakia in an attempt to
characterize the immune defect in this condition. Our patient's intracellular
cyclic-GMP levels were abnormally low (mean +/- S.D. of 0.17 +/- 0.05 pmol per
10(7) malakoplakia cells, versus 0.79 +/- 0.12 in normals) p less than 0.001).
After phagocytosis, his monocytes failed to release beta-glucuronidase. In the
bactericidal assay, incubation of the patient's monocytes with Escherichia coli
allowed growth of 542 +/- 46 colonies, normal monocytes allowed 95 +/- 22 (p less
than 0.001). The percentage of monocytes with large lysosomal granules was 23 +/-
4 in the patient and 4 +/- 2 in normal controls. After in vitro incubation of the
patient's cells or in vivo treatment with bethanechol chloride, the cyclic-GMP
levels, bactericidal ability and lysosomal granules of the cells returned to
normal levels. Low levels of cyclic-GMP could impair lysosomal function and
bacterial killing in this condition. Cholinergic agonists correct the in vitro
abnormalities and are beneficial in vivo.

Abnormality of a thiamine-requiring enzyme in patients with Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome.

Blass JP, Gibson GE.

We studied a thiamine-requiring enzyme in cultured cells from four patients with 
the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome to determine whether these patients have a
genetic predilection to thiamine deficiency. Transketolase in fibroblasts from
the patients with the syndrome bound thiamine pyrophosphate less avidly than
control lines. The apparent Km for thiamine pyrophosphate was 195 +/- 31 micron
for transketolase in extracts of the patients' cells as compared to 16 +/- 2
micron in six control lines (means +/- S.E.M.: P less than 0.001). The ranges
were 146 to 281 micron for the patients and 12 to 20 micron for the controls. The
abnormality in transketolase persisted through serial passages in tissue culture 
in cells grown in medium containing excess thiamine and no ethanol, indicating
that the aberrations were genetic rather than dietary. The abnormality of
transketolase in this syndrome would presumably be clinically unimportant if the 
diet was adequate. These patients appear to have deleterious inborn enzymatic
abnormalities of a type originally postulated by Garrod.

Reconstitution in severe combined immunodeficiency by transplantation of marrow
from an unrelated donor.

O'Reilly RJ, Dupont B, Pahwa S, Grimes E, Smithwick EM, Pahwa R, Schwartz S,
Hansen JA, Siegal FP, Sorell M, Svejgaard A, Jersild C, Thomsen M, Platz P,
L'Esperance P, Good RA.

A patient with severe combined immunodeficiency received seven transplants of
bone marrow from an HLA-B-compatible and HLA-D-compatible unrelated donor in an
attempt to provide immunologic reconstitution. The first four transplants
achieved restricted engraftment with evidence of rudimentary immunologic
function. A fifth transplant, given after low-dose cyclophosphamide, produced
reconstituion of cell-mediated immunity. Marrow aplasia developed after
recontamination with a nonpathogenic microflora. Transplantation of marrow
previously stored in liquid nitrogen was ineffective. A subsequent transplant,
administered after high-dose cyclophosphamide, achieved durable engraftment, with
complete hematopoietic and immunologic reconstitution. Seventeen months after
transplantation, full functional engraftment persists. Graft-versus-host disease 
has been chronic and moderately severe, but limited to the skin and oral mucosa. 
Transplantation of marrow from unrelated histocompatible donors may provide a
useful treatment for patients with severe combined immunodeficiency or aplastic
anemia who lack a matched sibling or related donor.

Selective deficiency of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. A cause of isolated
skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone.

Metz SA, Baylink DJ, Hughes MR, Haussler MR, Robertson RP.

To investigate the role of vitamin D metabolites in the pathogenesis of
pseudohypoparathyroidism, we studied an elderly man with a unique variant of the 
disease, which was characterized by hypocalcemia, elevated serum parathyroid
hormone (513 +/- 13 pg per milliliter, mean +/- S.E.M., normal, less than 450)
but normal renal responses (phosphate and cyclic AMP) to exogenous parathyroid
extract. Treatment with parathyroid extract did not produce a calcemic effect,
suggesting an isolated skeletal hyporesponsiveness to parathyroid hormone.
Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not reduced, levels of
1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were extremely low (0.52 ng per deciliter; normal
3.3 +/- 0.06, S.D.). Treatment with 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1 microgram by
mouth per day for four days) increased circulating levels to normal (4.60 ng per 
deciliter) and restored to normal the calcemic response to parathyroid (change in
calcium 3.0 mg per deciliter). These data suggest that
1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol deficiency may explain the skeletal resistance, but
not the renal resistance, often present in classic pseudohypoparathyroidism.

Sulfite oxidase deficiency. Biochemical and clinical investigations of a
hereditary metabolic disorder in sulfur metabolism.

Shih VE, Abroms IF, Johnson JL, Carney M, Mandell R, Robb RM, Cloherty JP,
Rajagopalan KV.

Study of a 4 1/2-year-old boy with the unusual combination of acute infantile
hemiplegia, ectopia lentis and the absence of homocystinuria showed large amounts
of abnormal sulfur-containing metabolites (sulfite, thiosulfate and
S-sulfocysteine) in the urine. Sulfite and S-sulfocysteine were also present in
the plasma. His inorganic sulfate excretion was only 50 per cent of total sulfur,
as compared with 75 to 95 per cent by controls. Loading with L-cysteine
hydrochloride and L-methionine further increased the excretion of sulfite and
thiosulfate, but not inorganic sulfate excretion. Sulfite oxidase activity in
skin fibroblasts average 1.07 nmol of cytochrome d reduced per milligram of
protein per minute in control lines; it was not detectable (less than 5 per cent)
in the patient. Activity was reduced in both parents (0.50 in the father and 0.32
in the mother)--compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance. Good biochemical
responses to a low sulfur amino acid diet suggest that early treatment may
benefit the patient.

Factitious hypoglycemia. Diagnosis by measurement of serum C-peptide
immunoreactivity and insulin-binding antibodies.

Scarlett JA, Mako ME, Rubenstein AH, Blix PM, Goldman J, Horwitz DL, Tager H,
Jaspan JB, Stjernholm MR, Olefsky JM.

In seven patients with factitious hypoglycemia due to the surreptitious injection
of insulin, we made the diagnosis by measurements of plasma insulin and C-peptide
immunoreactivity (in seven patients), facilitated by the finding of circulating
insulin-binding antibodies (in two patients). The simultaneous demonstration of
low plasma glucose, high immunoreactive insulin and suppressed C-peptide
immunoreactivity represents a triad of results pathognomonic of exogenous insulin
administration. Determination of plasma free C-peptide and free insulin permitted
patients with high titers of insulin antibodies, including those with a history
of insulin-treated diabetes, to be studied and diagnosed in a way similar to that
in subjects who had no circulating insulin antibodies.

Laboratory-acquired Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The hazard of aerosol
transmission.

Oster CN, Burke DS, Kenyon RH, Ascher MS, Harber P, Pedersen CE Jr.

Nine patients with laboratory-acquired Rocky Mountain spotted fever were seen
during the period 1971 to 1976. Investigation of each case revealed either
definite or probable exposure to an aerosol containing infectious rickettsiae; in
no case was there evidence of parenteral exposure either by accidental
self-inoculation or by tick bite. These illnesses are believed to represent
infection acquired via the respiratory route. This report emphasizes the aerosol 
hazard of Rickettsia rickettsii in the laboratory and discusses the possibility
of respiratory transmission of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in nature. The
illness occurred only in personnel who had received either no vaccination or the 
primary series of the commercial (Lederie) vaccine against this infection. Other 
personnel who had received the primary series with multiple booster vaccinations 
demonstrated increased immunity as measured by humoral antibody titers and
rickettsial antigen-induced lymphocyte transformation; no cases of clinical
disease developed in these multiply-vaccinated personnel.

Lassa fever: response to an imported case.

Zweighaft RM, Fraser DW, Hattwick MA, Winkler WG, Jordan WC, Alter M, Wolfe M,
Wulff H, Johnson KM.

In February, 1976, a Peace Corps worker returned to the United States from Sierra
Leone with an undiagnosed illness later recognized as Lassa fever. To assess the 
risk of transmission and to contain a potential outbreak, we identified 552
contacts as having had exposure to the patient before the start of strict
isolation procedures, and maintained intensive surveillance on these contacts for
21 days. At the end of the surveillance period, no illness had developed in
contacts. One month later, a serologic survey among 29 of the contacts judged to 
be at high risk gave no evidence of infection. In response to the importation of 
this communicable and highly fatal disease, procedures for the isolation of the
patient, the identification, surveillance and management of contacts and the
handling of laboratory specimens were developed and implemented. These procedures
could be adapted to future introductions of highly contagious diseases.

Autoimmune vitiligo: detection of antibodies to melanin-producing cells.

Hertz KC, Gazze LA, Kirkpatrick CH, Katz SI.

Vitiligo, a disorder characterized by the destruction of melanocytes, is often
associated with diseases in which there are increased frequencies of
autoantibodies. For this reason we investigated two patients with vitiligo,
alopecia universalis, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and multiple endocrine
insufficiencies for antibodies to melanin-producing cells. Using direct
immunofluorescence of normal and vitiliginous skin from both patients and
indirect immunofluorescence with both patients' serum, we could not detect these 
antibodies. However, an immunofluorescent complement-fixation test demonstrated a
circulating antibody that bound to melanocytes in human skin, nevus cells and
melanoma cells. Specificity of cellular fluorescence for nevus and melanoma cells
was shown on serial sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and was inferred 
for melanocytes from their distribution in human skin and their presence when the
normal but not vitiliginous skin of both patients was used as substrate. This
antibody was characterized as an IgG that activated complement via the classical 
pathway.

A cluster of Epstein-Barr-virus-associated American Burkitt's lymphoma.

Judson SC, Henle W, Henle G.

We investigated four patients in whom histologically confirmed Burkitt's
lymphomas developed during a one-year period. They were young adults living
within 50 km of each other in a rural area of Pennsylvania. Two patients were
related by marriage, but there was no contact with or between the other two.
Although the majority of American Burkitt's lymphomas are not associated with the
Epstein-Barr virus, all four patients showed spectra and titers of antibodies to 
antigens related to that virus that were characteristic of virus-associated
Burkitt's lymphoma in Africa. Viral DNA and numerous cells with virus-determined 
nuclear antigen were found in tumor specimens available from three patients.
These cases are unusual, since time-space clustering of Burkitt's lymphoma
associated with Epstein-Barr virus has been observed thus far only in Africa.

Autonomy for burned patients when survival is unprecedented.

Imbus SH, Zawacki BE.

Altered states of consciousness often exclude the seriously burned patient from
decision making in his own case. During the first few hours of hospitalization,
however, even the most severely burned patient is usually alert and mentally
competent. When burns are so severe that survival is unprecedented, we use an
aggressive approach to decision making to preserve patient autonomy. While still 
lucid, and with sufficient information, the patient is asked if he wishes to
choose between a full therapeutic regimen or ordinary care, reassured that with
either choice, the burn team will provide the constant presence of human caring
and full use of its professional skills. This approach has not changed the
mortality rate of such patients, but has increased both the self-determination
that they exercise and the empathy that they receive.

Chronic progressive poliomyelitis secondary to vaccination of an immunodeficient 
child.

Davis LE, Bodian D, Price D, Butler IJ, Vickers JH.

We investigated an immunodeficient child in whom chronic progressive
poliomyelitis developed after she had received live oral poliovirus vaccine.
Poliovirus, Type II, was isolated from throat and stool during life and from
several sites within the brain at autopsy. The brain isolate was classified as
vaccine-like on the basis of temperature sensitivity and antigenic markers.
However, in the monkey neurovirulence test, the brain isolate produced moderately
severe lesions throughout the spinal cord and brainstem and appeared
nonvaccine-like. Thus, the brain isolate demonstrated a dissociation between the 
antigenic and neurovirulence markers. Our observations suggest that, under
unusual circumstances, such as immunodeficiency, attenuated poliovirus can
produce a chronic progressive neurologic disease. This case also emphasizes the
need to diagnose immunodeficiency as early as possible, so that live-virus
vaccines will not be administered.

Complete deficiency of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. Report of a family.

Van Acker KJ, Simmonds HA, Potter C, Cameron JS.

We studied the clinical and biochemical manifestations of complete adenine
phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency in the kindred of a male homozygous child
excreting stones of 2,8-dihydroxyade-nine. Abnormal amounts of adenine,
8-hydroxyade-nine and 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (25 per cent of total purine
metabolites) appeared in the urine of the propositus and his clinically normal
brother, but not in heterozygotes or a control. Adenine
phosphoribosyl-transferase activity in erythrocytes was less than 1 per cent of
normal in both homozygotes and varied from 20 to 57 per cent of normal in six
heterozygotes. Heterozygotes exhibited neither hyperuricemia nor gout. Treatment 
of the propositus with allopurinol and a low purine diet stopped stone formation.
In addition, excretion of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine decreased. An autosomal recessive 
mode of inheritance with variable expression in the phenotype is indicated.
Homozygotes may be detected by their raised urinary adenine levels or absence of 
detectable erythrocyte adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity (or both).

Syndrome of acquired factor X deficiency and systemic amyloidosis in vivo studies
of the metabolic fate of factor X.

Furie B, Greene E, Furie BC.

To determine the metabolic fate of factor X in primary amyloidosis associated
with factor X deficiency, we examined the pathways of its catabolism in a man
with this syndrome. Intravenous infusion of human or bovine 131I-labeled factor X
established a triphasic plasma clearance pattern for factor X. About 85 per cent 
of the factor X disappeared, with a disappearance half-time of less than 30
seconds. A second and third phase showed a T1/2 of 90 minutes and nine hours
respectively. 131I-labeles factor X in plasma did not appear to be rapidly
modified or degraded. Relatively minor quantities of 131I were cleared into the
urine. We observed a diffuse distribution of radioactivity over the body surface,
with a concentration in the hepatic and splenic regions. These studies
demonstrate than factor X deficiency associated with systemic amyloidosis is due 
to binding of factor X to body tissue, probably within the circulatory system.

Low-titer cold-hemagglutinin disease. Mechanism of hemolysis and response to
corticosteroids.

Schreiber AD, Herskovitz BS, Goldwein M.

We studied two patients with a low-titer cold-hemagglutinin disease syndrome to
investigate the mechanism of hemolysis and the therapeutic response to
corticosteroids. The antierythrocyte antibody was of the IgM class, had a high
thermal amplitude and had enough activity of 37 degrees C to account for the
hemolysis. The capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to increase the osmotic
fragility of C3-coated erythrocytes suggests that macrophage interaction with
C3-coated erythrocytes explains the observed in vivo spherocytosis. Both patients
responded to high-dose corticosteroids. The data suggest that the steroid effect 
is probably due to alteration of macrophage complement-receptor function. These
studies demonstrate the importance of antibody activity at body temperature in
producing hemolysis, particularly in this variant of cold-hemagglutinin disease. 
The response to steroids suggests the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in
alleviating hemolysis due to macrophage recognition of erythrocytes coated with
IgM and C3.

Persistent and fatal central-nervous-system ECHOvirus infections in patients with

We observed persistent ECHOvirus infection of the central nervous system, as
defined by continued presence of isolatable virus in cerebrospinal fluid, in five
patients with agammaglobulinemia. The immunologic deficit in each was
characterized by absence of surface-immunoglobulin-bearing B lymphocytes and of
lymph-node cortical follicles, but normal T-cell function. ECHOviruses 30, 19, 9 
and 33 were recovered from cerebrospinal fluid for periods varying from two
months to three years. The patients had few signs of acute central-nervous-system
infection. Three of the five patients had a dermatomyositis-like syndrome, with
peripheral lymphocytes that reacted with anti-human leukemia-specific primate and
rabbit serums in a cytotoxicity assay. These data suggest that intact B-cell
function is essential for eradication of ECHOvirus infection of the central
nervous system.

Familial hemochromatosis. Physiologic studies in the precirrhotic stage of the
disease.

Feller ER, Pont A, Wands JR, Carter EA, Foster G, Kourides IA, Isselbacher KJ.

We studied 12 members of a family with precirrhotic hemochromatosis to define the
physiologic abnormalities in the asymptomatic phase of the disease. Six of 12 had
increased iron stores; the mode of inheritance was consistent with an autosomal
dominant trait. Serum ferritin levels were no more predictive of tissue iron
levels than measurements of serum iron, transferrin saturation or chelatable iron
excretion. In three affected family members intestinal iron content was normal.
Liver proline hydroxylase activity and urinary hydroxyproline excretion did not
correlate with tissue iron content, suggesting that, in addition to the possible 
role of tissue iron, hepatic fibrosis may involve other factors. "Borderline
diabetes mellitus" was present in three affected family members, but extensive
studies revealed that pituitary dysfunction is uncommon in early hemochromatosis.
Increased levels of liver iron proved to be the most reliable marker for the
disease.

Hypoglycemia of infancy and nesidioblastosis. Studies with somatostatin.

Hirsch HJ, Loo S, Evans N, Crigler JF, Filler RM, Gabbay KH.

We treated a two-month-old infant with servere intractable hypoglycemia and
nesidioblastosis with continuous glucose infusions (0.75 g per kilogram per hour)
via a central venous catheter. Preprandial glucose levels on this regimen were
37+/-2 mg per deciliter (+/-S.E.M.). Basal serum insulin levels were within
normal fasting levels for this age group but inappropriately elevated for the
blood glucose levels. The beta cells were exquisitely sensitive to infusions of
synthetic cyclic somatostatin, with a dose-dependent rise in blood glucose and
concomitant suppression of serum insulin levels. There was only minimal
suppression of plasma glucagon levels. Single subcutaneous injections of 50
microng of protamine zinc somatostatin raised preprandial blood glucose levels to
83+/-3 mg per deciliter for four to five days although preprandial hormone levels
were unchanged. These findings indicate that hypoglycemia of infancy is a
hyperinsulin state with abnormal basal regulation of insulin secretion.

Erythropoiesis in familial erythrocytosis.

Greenberg BR, Golde DW.

We found primary erythrocytosis in two male siblings with hematologically normal 
parents. To clarify the abnormalities in erythropoiesis, we studied
erythropoietin production in the older sibling as well as in vivo and in vitro
responses of bone marrow to various stimuli. His erythropoietin excretion after a
1000-ml phlebotomy increased by 0 to 11 units per day. In liquid-suspension
culture, erythropoiesis was prominently augmented by erythropoietin and
unstimulated erythropoiesis was greater and more prolonged than normal. Numbers
of erythroid colonies rose in methylcellulose culture without exogenous
erythropoietin, and cloning increased with added erythropoietin.
Anti-erythropoietin antibody substantially decreased erythropoiesis in vitro.
Increased bone-marrow erythropoiesis was also demonstrated in murine diffusion
chambers. The principal abnormality in this familial erythrocytosis appears to be
a greatly expanded erythropoietic precursor pool that is responsive to
erythropoietin in vitro and in vivo. This abnormality is analogous to the
functional erythropoietic defect in typical polycythemia vera.

Mechanism of feminization in primary liver cancer.

Kew MC, Kirschner MA, Abrahams GE, Katz M.

Primary liver cancer occasionally presents with feminization. The mechanism is
unknown. We studied a young man with primary liver cancer associated with
feminization that disappeared after removal of the tumor. Before operation, the
serum estrone level was markedly (1113 pg per milliliter) and estradiol and
estriol levels were slightly elevated. Human placental lactogen was also
increased (0.52 microng per milliliter). Luteinizing hormone,
follicle-stimulating hormone and prolactin levels were normal, and testosterone
reduced. Beta subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin were not detected in the
serum. In vitro assay of tumor tissue showed estrogenic activity and high levels 
of these subunits. With a reversed isotope dilution technic with crystallization 
to constant specific activity, we showed the tumor tissue to convert
dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone to estrone and
estradiol. Production of beta subunits of chorionic gonadotropin and raised serum
levels of placental lactogen provided further evidence that the tumor was
functioning as trophoblastic tissue.

"Somatostatinoma": a somatostatin-containing tumor of the endocrine pancreas.

Ganda OP, Weir GC, Soeldner JS, Legg MA, Chick WL, Patel YC, Ebeid AM, Gabbay KH,
Reichlin S.

We studied the pancreatic and enteric hormone profile of a 46-year-old woman who 
had hyperglycemia and a pancreatic tumor. Before operation, there was no evidence
of overproduction of glucagon or insulin. The tumor's ultrastructure had a
distinctive endocrine morphology, resembling D cells. Prompted by the recent
demonstration of somatostatin in D cells of pancreatic islets, we analyzed the
tumor and found a large quantity of immunoreactive somatostatin (301 ng per
milligram of tissue). Insulin, glucagon, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide and human pancreatic polypeptide were present in only trace
quantities. The tumor cells were cultured in monolayers, which remained viable up
to 51 days and released somatostatin into the culture medium. In seven
insulinomas and two glucagonomas, we found the somatostatin content either much
lower (less than 0.6 ng per milligram of tissue) or undetectable. After complete 
resection of the tumor, our patient became euglycemic and has remained so for the
past 20 months.

Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency associated with selective cellular
immunodeficiency.

Stoop JW, Zegers BJ, Hendrickx GF, van Heukelom LH, Staal GE, de Bree PK, Wadman 
SK, Ballieux RE.

We studied a 15-month-old girl who had normal T-cell and B-cell immunity at
birth, after which a gradual decrease in T-cell immunity developed. This
selective cellular immunodeficiency was inherited as an autosomal recessive
trait: two older sisters had the same immunodeficiency. Adenosine deaminase
activity was present in erythrocytes and lymphocytes of the patient, parents and 
a healthy brother. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity was not found in the 
patient's erythrocytes and lymphocytes (the parents and brother had intermediate 
values, indicating that the enzyme deficiency too was inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait). Analysis of serum and urine from the patient and of serum from 
her two deceased sisters showed high levels of inosine and guanosine in addition 
to hypouricemia and hypouricosuria. The bone marrow was megaloblastic, and the
blood hypochromic microcytic. The patient had spastic tetraparesis. Intoxication 
of the T lymphocytes after birth by metabolic products may explain the
progressive cellular immunodeficiency.

Familial hyperglucagonemia--an autosomal dominant disorder.

Boden G, Owen OE.

Basal immunoreactive glucagon was elevated in four of nine asymptomatic relatives
of a patient with glucagonoma. Immunoreactive glucagon remained elevated
throughout 22 to 25 hours of continuous observation. Glucagon responses to
intravenous glucose and arginine or mixed meals (or both) were abnormal, whereas 
glucose and insulin responses were normal. Gel filtration of plasma revealed that
over 85 per cent of the four relatives' immunoreactive glucagon had a molecular
weight of greater than 9000 daltons whereas that of 70 per cent of the patients
with glucagonoma had a molecular weight of 3500 daltons, with the remainder
eluting in the area of 9000 daltons. Pancreatic angiograms and hepatic
scintiscans were normal in all four relatives. The data suggest an autosomal
dominant transmission of hyperglucagonemia in this family. Immunoreactive
glucagon with a molecular weight of 3500 or 9000 daltons appears to be required
for the development of the clinical glucagonoma syndrome.

Failure of complete bile diversion and oral bile acid therapy in the treatment of
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Deckelbaum RJ, Lees RS, Small DM, Hedberg SE, Grundy SM.

Two patients with nomozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, refractory to medical
therapy, underwent complete bile diversion by common-duct ligation and
cholecystostomy, in an attempt to arrest the progression of their xanthomatosis
and atherosclerosis by depletion of body cholesterol. Clofibrate was given after 
operation to one patient, and cholic acid to both, in an effort to enhance
further the negative sterol balance. Bile diversion produced an increase of six
to eight times in gastrointestinal sterol output, which was not increased further
by either clofibrate or cholic acid therapy. Despite a calculated sterol loss of 
560 g over 14 months in one patient and 400 g over 10 months in the other,
neither plasma cholesterol nor xanthoma size decreased. Continuity of the biliary
tree was therefore restored. The data suggest that patients with homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia respond to even massive gastrointestinal sterol
depletion with equal increases in sterol synthesis.

Linkage between the gene (or genes) controlling synthesis of the fourth component
of complement and the major histocompatibility complex.

Ochs HD, Rosenfeld SI, Thomas ED, Giblett ER, Alper CA, Dupont B, Schaller JG,
Gilliland BC, Hansen JA, Wedgwood RJ.

In an attempt to map the gene (or genes) controlling the synthesis fo the fourth 
component of complement (C4), we performed linkage studies in a family with
hereditary C4 deficiency. The proband, a seven-year-old boy with lupus
erythematosus, consistently lacked deteftable serum C4 by both functional and
protein measurements. The complement defect was transmitted as an autosomal
recessive disorder. Eight of 15 family members were considered to be
heterozygotes, seven because of low C4 levels and one because of genetic data
(obligate heterozygote). The gene (or genes) coding for C4 deficiency appeared to
be linked to the major histocompatibility complex (A2,B12,DW2 on the maternal
side and A2,BW15,LD108 on the paternal side) and to other markers known to be in 
close proximity to the histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6
(phosphoglucomutase-3, glyoxalase-1 and properdin factor B).

Aspirin-induced depression of renal function.

Kimberly RP, Plotz PH.

We observed elevation of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen and decrease in
creatine clearance in patients taking anti-inflammatory doses of aspirin. In 13
of 23 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus increases in serum creatinine
ranged from 27 to 163 per cent, and those in urea nitrogen from 42 to 270 per
cent. Sequential creatinine-clearance studies, available in 11 of the 13
patients, demonstrated decreases up to 58 per cent. Patients with aspirin-induced
changes in renal function were more likely to have active renal disease (P
=0.035) or hypocomplementemia (P =0.030). Four of 22 patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and two of three normal volunteers also demonstrated biochemical
changes. The rate of aspirin-induced alterations was significantly higher in
systemic lupus erythematosus (P =0.007) than in rheumatoid arthritis. Aspirin,
and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, can have a major reversible
effect on renal function that may influence the interpretation of clinical data.

Autoimmune panleukopenia.

Cline MJ, Opelz G, Saxon A, Fahey JL, Golde DW.

A patient with episodic panleukopenia involving neutrophilic granulocytes,
monocytes and lymphocytes had recurrent bacterial infections and a circulating
cytotoxin that injured primitive myeloid cells as well as differentiated
granulocytes and mononuclear cells. The cytotoxin was an immunoglobulin with
activity against mouse, as well as human, myeloid stem cells. Clinical remission 
during cyclophosphamide therapy was associated with disappearance of the
circulating leukocytotoxin. Serum from a period of active disease was cytotoxic
for the patient's own lymphocytes obtained during clinical remission. Absorption 
of cytotoxic serum with granulocytes removed activity against both granulocytes
and lymphocytes. These studies suggest an autoimmune disease in man characterized
by episodic granulocytopenia, monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia due to humoral
antibody against non-HLA antigens shared by several hematopoietic cell lines.

Abnormal purine metabolism and purine overproduction in a patient deficient in
purine nucleoside phosphorylase.

Cohen A, Doyle D, Martin DW Jr, Ammann AJ.

To delineate the normal function of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and to
understand the pathogenesis of the immune dysfunction associated with deficiency 
of this enzyme, we studied purine metabolism in a patient deficient in purine
nucleoside phosphorylase, her erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts. She
exhibited severe hypouricemia and hypouricosuria but excreted excessive amounts
of purines in her urine, the major components of which were inosine and
guanosine. Her urine also contained deoxyinosine, deoxyguanosine and uric acid
9-N riboside. The patient's erythrocytes but not her cultured fibroblasts
contained increased concentrations of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate and inosine.
The metabolic abnormalities resembled those in the erythrocytes of patients with 
the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase is a necessary
component of the major, if not the sole, pathway for the conversion of purine
nucleosides and nucleotides to uric acid. The increased intracellular
concentrations of inosine may, by inhibiting adenosine deaminase, be related to
the immunologic dysfunction.

Deaths from paracervical anesthesia used for first-trimester abortion, 1972-1975.

Grimes DA, Cates W Jr.

Since January 1, 1972, five women in the United States are reported to have died 
from paracervical anesthesia used for first-trimester abortions. This report
describes the three most recent deaths. Toxic doses of lidocaine, substantiated
by post-mortem blood levels of 5 and 9 mug per milliliter, probably led to two
deaths; an intolerance to or inadvertent intravenous administration of
mepivacaine probably caused the third. Administration of an appropriate dose of
local anesthetic appears to be the single most important factor in preventing
catastrophic reactions.

Enzyme replacement therapy for adenosine deaminase deficiency and severe combined
immunodeficiency.

Polmar SH, Stern RC, Schwartz AL, Wetzler EM, Chase PA, Hirschhorn R.

To evaluate their role as a form of replacement therapy, frozen irradiated red
blood cells were administered to a child with adenosine deaminase deficiency
associated with severe combined immunodeficiency disease. In vitro lymphocyte
responses to mitogens and allogeneic cells were restored. Subsequently, a "thymus
shadow" appeared, and immunoglobulin synthesis was demonstrated. Frozen
irradiated plasma, which alone had no effect on lymphocytes numbers or responses,
promoted lymphocytosis when given with frozen irradiated red blood cells. The
patient received the transfusions with or without irradiated plasma at four-week 
intervals and remained free of infection for 17 months. The patient's lymphocyte 
adenosine triphosphate levels were elevated before therapy, which consistently
reduced them without altering the lymphocyte adenosine deaminase activity. Enzyme
replacement therapy may provide a way to treat patients with adenosine deaminase 
deficiency associated with severe combined immunodeficiency disease who do not
have histocompatible bone-marrow donors.

Correction of leukocyte function in Chediak-Higashi syndrome by ascorbate.

Boxer LA, Watanabe AM, Rister M, Besch HR Jr, Allen J, Baehner RL.

Because ascorbate potentiates chemotaxis of normal leukocytes, we examined the
effect of ascorbate on polymorphonuclear leukocytes from a patient with the
Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Chemotactic migration was 104+/-16 leukocytes per 10
fields (mean+/-S.D.) initially and 258+/-44 (P less than 0.001) after ascorbate, 
as compared to 182+/-10 in controls. There was no bactericidal activity by 40
minutes in the patient's untreated leukocytes. After ascorbate bactericidal
activity of patient and untreated control cells was the same. The addition of
ascorbate reduced cAMP levels in the patient's cells from a mean of 34.5 pmoles
per 10(7) polymorphonuclear leukocytes to 5.9, as compared to a control value of 
3.1+/-1.4. The association of elevated cAMP and impaired function in the
polymorphonuclear leukocytes of patients with the Chediak-Higashi syndrome may be
related to abnormal microtubular assembly.

Leydig-cell agenesis: a cause of male pseudohermaphroditism.

Berthezène F, Forest MG, Grimaud JA, Claustrat B, Mornex R.

We studied a 35-year-old patient with female external genitalia, primary
amenorrhea and XY karytotype. Plasma testosterone was 10 ng per deciliter, which 
did not change after administration of human chorionic gonadotropin, increased to
22 ng per deciliter after ACTH, and decreased to 0.9 ng per deciliter after
dexamethasone. Plasma delta 4-androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and
17-hydroxyprogesterone were in the normal range. Plasma luteinizing hormone was
high, but follicle-stimulating hormone normal (7.5 mlU per milliliter). There
were two testes with epididymis and vas deferens, but no Mullerian structures.
Microscopical examination showed hyalinization of tubules, which were lined by
normal Sertoli cells and occasional immature germ cells. No Leydig cells were
seen. After castration follicle-stimulating hormone increased to 43 mlU per
milliliter. We conclude that this case of male pseudohermaphroditism was probably
due to a Leydig-cell agenesis, that the epididymis and vas deferens can be
developed in such a condition and the follicle-stimulating hormone secretion is
regulated, at least in part, by a non-androgen substance secreted by Sertoli
cells.

Respiratory failure associated with familial depression of ventilatory response
to hypoxia and hypercapnia.

Moore GC, Zwillich CW, Battaglia JD, Cotton EK, Weil JV.

Respiratory failure has been associated with depressed ventilatory responses to
hypoxia or hypercapnia or both. The possibility that familial factors are
responsible for decreased chemosensitivity prompted this study of a child with
unexplained respiratory failure and normal lung function. We found his
ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia to be virtually absent. Studies
of six healthy immediate family members (parents and siblings) showed that
hypoxic response, as measured by an index of the relation between ventilation and
hypoxia (index A), was consistently reduced: 45 +/- 8.7 S.E.M. (normal, 127 +/-
8.7) (P less than 0.005). Response to hypercapnia, measured as the slope of the
ventilatory response to hypercapnia, was lower than normal, averaging 0.95 +/-
0.16 liters per minute per millimeter of mercury (normal, 1.76 +/- 0.13) (P less 
than 0.01). The patient's respiratory failure seemed related to deficient
ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. It seems likely that this
depressed hypoxic response is of familial origin.

Serologic detection of a y-linked gene in xx males and xx true hermaphrodites.

Wachtel SS, Koo GC, Breg WR, Thaler HT, Dillard GM, Rosenthal IM, Dosik H, Gerald
PS, Saenger P, New M, Lieber E, Miller OJ.

To test the hypothesis that H-Y antigen (present on both somatic and germ cells
in normal males but not normal females) is essential for testicular
differentiation, we studied four XX males and three XX true hermaphrodites. Blood
cells from six subjects and cultured gonadal fibroblasts from a seventh expressed
H-Y antigen. Since expression of this antigen requires the presence of a gene
normally carried by the Y chromosome, this gene, and perhaps additional Y
chromosomal material, should have been present in the genome of these subjects.
In one patient this presence is accounted for by a Y-to-X translocation,
detectable by chromosome banding. In another a normal Y chromosome was present in
a minor population of cells. In the remaining five, no karyotypic abnormality was
detectable. Immunologic detection of H-Y antigen is a sensitive test for the
presence of the Y chromosome or of its male-determining segment.

Acute myelobalstic leukemia and hypercalcemia. A case of probable ectopic
parathyroid hormone production.

Zidar BL, Shadduck RK, Winkelstein A, Zeigler Z, Hawker CD.

We studied a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia, hypercalcemia,
hypophosphatemia and inappropriately elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels to
define the mechanism of the hypercalcemia. On six occasions during two years,
hypercalcemia occurred in conjunction with relapses of leukmia. Each time, serum 
calcium decreased to normal levels in parallel with reduction of the leukemic
mass. During two periods of hypercalcemia, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone
values were abnormally high. In addition, hormone was detected in vitro after
short-term incubation of the leukemic cells (after 24 hours, the patient's cells 
produced 129 pg of PTH per milliliter, whereas myeloblasts from a normocalcemic
patient with leukemia produced only 33 pg). In freeze-thawing experiments, 39 pg 
of parathyroid hormone was released form 1 x 108 of the patient's myeloblasts; no
hormone was released from the normocalcemia cells. These findings suggest that
the hypercalcemia resulted from ectopic parathyroid hormone production by
leukemic cells.

Big renin and biosynthetic defect of aldosterone in diabetes mellitus.

deLeiva A, Christlieb AR, Melby JC, Graham CA, Day RP, Luetscher JA, Zager PG.

To determine the cause of selective aldosterone deficiency in two patients with
diabetes mellitus, studies of renin and of aldosterone-precursor metabolites were
performed under conditions of sodium depletion and ACTH stimulation. Plasma renin
concentration was elevated in both patients, and stimulated plasma renin activity
was low in one and normal in the other. Fractionation of plasma extracts
demonstrated the presence of "big renin," a relatively inactive precursor of
renin. Metabolites of aldosterone precursors were increased, suggesting deficient
18-hydroxylase in one patient and dehydrogenase in the other. The results suggest
that hypoaldosteronism in diabetic patients may result from combined defects in
both renin and aldosterone biosynthesis.

Concentration of 3', 5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate in ventricular
cerebrospinal fluid of patients with prolonged coma after head trauma or
intracranial hemorrhage.

Rudman D, Fleischer A, Kutner MH.

A previous study showed that cerebrospinal fluid from the lateral ventricle of
patients without disturbance of sensorium or intracranial pressure contains 15 to
30 nm 3', 5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate. We measured the concentration of
this cyclic nucleotide by radioimmunoassay in cerebrospinal fluid from the
lateral ventricle of six patients with prolonged coma (20 days or longer) after
head trauma (four), or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (two). Coma was graded
IV to I in order of decreasing severity. Fluid was removed at intervals of six to
72 hours from a Rickham reservoir placed in the lateral ventricle. Concentration 
of the cyclic nucleotide (mean +/- S.E.M.) in coma of Grades IV, III, II and I
was 2.1 +/- 0.3, 4.6 +/- 0.5, 6.3 +/- 1.4 and 12.5 +/- 2.4 nM respectively. After
sensorium became normal, cAMP was 21.0 +/- 1.4 nM. Correlation between grade of
coma and concentration was -0.89 (P less than 0.01). Thus, prolonged coma appears
to be associated with a disturbance of cyclic AMP metabolism within the central
nervous system.

Jamaican vomiting sickness. Biochemical investigation of two cases.

Tanaka K, Kean EA, Johnson B.

We identified methylenecyclopropylacetic acid, a known metabolite of hypoglycin
A, in the urine of two patients with Jamaican vomiting sickness. Excretion of
unusual dicarboxylic acids such as 2-ethylmalonic, 2-methylsuccinic, glutaric,
adipic and dicarboxylic acids with eight and 10 carbon chains were also detected 
in both patients. The amounts of these dicarboxylic acids were 70 to 1000 times
higher than normal. These metabolites have also been identified in urine of
hypoglycin-treated rats. This evidence links hypoglycin A to Jamaican vomiting
sickness as its causative agent. Urinary excretion of short-chain fatty acids was
also increased up to 300 times higher than normal. These results indicate that,
despite their clinical and histologic similarities, the cause and biochemical
mechanisms of Jamaican vomiting sickness differ distinctly from those of Reye's
syndrome in which these abnormal urinary metabolites are not appreciably
increased.

Methylmalonic aciduria without vitamin B12 deficiency in an adult sibship.

Giorgio AJ, Trowbridge M, Boone AW, Patten RS.

Two brothers 62 and 70 years old, without evidence of vitamin B12 lack, excreted 
12 to 115 mg of methylmalonic acid daily (normal, less than 9 mg per day).
Neither had anemia or hepatic dysfunction, and serum vitamin B12 concentrations
ranged from 369 to 800 pg per milliliter. The propositus, the younger brother,
continued to excrete excessive methylmalonate, 103 to 115 mg per day, after 2000 
mug of parenterally administered vitamin B12 at the fifth and 11th months of
study. Leukocyte activities of the cobalamin-linked enzyme methylmalonyl coenzyme
A mutase were respectively reduced in the propositus and his brother, to 0.04 and
0.11 nmoles of 3-(14)-C Ls methylmalonyl coenzyme A metabolized per hour per
milligram of leukocyte protein (normal, 0.286 +/- 0.079 [S.D.]). These activities
were not enhanced by 2 mug of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin added to the assays. A
heritable benign form of adult methylmalonic aciduria rather than vitamin B12
lack best explains these findings.

Heparin-induced immune thrombocytopenia.

Babcock RB, Dumper CW, Scharfman WB.

We studied five patients in whom severe thrombocytopenia developed during
intermittent intravenous heparin treatment of arterial and venous thrombosis.
Platelet aggregation was demonstrated when heparin (0.5 U per milliliter) was
incubated with the patients' citrated platelet-rich plasma or with normal
platelet-rich plasma in the presence of the patients' serum. Antiplatelet
antibody was not detected in the patient globulin fractions prepared from serum
collected within one week after heparin withdrawal by use of the platelet factor 
3 availability technic. When the studies were repeated with modifications to
detect heparin-dependent antiplatelet antibodies, positive results were obtained 
in four of five patients. The data suggest that a casual relation, mediated by an
immune mechanism, existed between heparin therapy and thrombocytopenia, and that 
this syndrome may occur more often than has previously.

Hyperuricosuria due to high-dose pancreatic extract therapy in cystic fibrosis.

Stapleton FB, Kennedy J, Nousia-Arvanitakis S, Linshaw MA.

Dysuria, uric acid crystalluria and hyperuricosuria developed in a child with
cystic fibrosis and normal serum uric acid. Hyperuricosuria in this patient and
two other children was directly related to ingestion of large amounts of
pancreatic extract. In these three children, reducing pancreatic extract dosage
by 85 percent lowered their purine intake by 307, 225, and 148 mg, respectively; 
urinary uric acid excretion decreased by 245, 239, and 158 mg. Overmedication
resulted from parents' decisions to increase enzyme dosages. In our cystic
fibrosis clinic, 15 of 32 patients screened at random were taking higher than the
prescribed dose of pancreatic enzymes, and 14 of these 15 children were
hyperuricosuric. On the basis of this information, we suggest that the minimal
effective dose of pancreatic extract should be determined and adhered to for each
child with cystic fibrosis to avoid potential renal injury from hyperuricosuria.

Elevated plasma proglucagon-like component with a glucagon-secreting tumor.
Effect of streptozotocin.

Danforth DN Jr, Triche T, Doppman JL, Beazley RM, Perrino PV, Recant L.

To determine the character of the glucagon secretion and its modification by
streptozotocin, were studied the plasma of a patient with recurrent pancreatic
alpha-cell carcinoma. The plasma immunoreactive glucagon level before treatment
of 4.80 ng per milliliter. Biogel column separation of the plasma immunoreactive 
glucagon revealed four components; the predominant component had a molecular
weight of 9000 daltons and was designated as proglucagon-like. This fraction
constituted 60 to 90 per cent of the total circulating immunoreactive glucagon,
and had a biologic activity of 32 percent of that of an immunoequivalent amount
of normal (porcine) pancreatic glucagon. After treatment with streptozocin (1.5 g
per square meter) the plasma immunoreactive glucagon level decreased to 0.24 ng
per milliliter. Treatment was accompanied by a marked reduction in the
proglucagon-like component and the appearance of pancreatic glucagon (molecular
weight of 3500 daltons) as the major post-therapy fraction. These findings
support the use of streptozotocin in the management of unresectable
glucagon-secreting tumors.

Parathyroid autotransplantation in primary parathyroid hyperplasia.

Wells SA Jr, Ellis GJ, Gunnells JC, Schneider AB, Sherwood LM.

Four patients with primary parathyroid hyperplasia were treated by total
parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue into the forearm 
muscle. All patients remained normocalcemic after vitamin D and oral calcium
replacement therapy were stopped at 1 1/2, four, nine and 13 months,
respectively. Graft function was documented further by detection of a higher
concentration of parathyroid hormone in plasma from the basilic vein draining the
graft bed than from the basilic vein in the contralateral arm. Intravenous
calcium infusion suppressed parathyroid hormone secretion from the graft whereas 
hypocalcemia induced by ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid markedly stimulated
hormone release. In two patients histologic examination of a grafted fragment
revealed hyperplastic parathyroid tissue. This method of treatment offers a
suitable alternative to radical subtotal parathyroidectomy in selected patients
with hyperparathyroidism.

Hemoglobin Beth Israel. A mutant causing clinically apparent cyanosis.

Nagel RL, Lynfield J, Johnson J, Landau L, Bookchin RM, Harris MB.

We found that an abnormal hemoglobin with a very low oxygen affinity was
responsible for overt cyanosis in an otherwise healthy adolescent. Hemoglobin
Beth Israel, in which serine replaces the asparagine residue normally present at 
position 102 (G4) of the beta-polypeptide chain, was associated with normal blood
counts and no apparent exercise intolerance in the heterozygous carrier. Cyanosis
resulted from a drastically right-shifted oxygen dissociation curve, whose
position and shape could account for the absence of "physiologic" anemia. The
whole-blood oxygen tension at 50 per cent oxygen saturation was 88 mm Hg
(normally 26 +/- 1 mm Hg), and the arterial blood was only 63 per cent saturated 
with oxygen despite a normal oxygen tension of 97 mm Hg. The hemolysate showed a 
low oxygen affinity but normal Bohr effect. Unexplained cyanosis, particularly in
association with normal arterial oxygen tension should prompt a search for an
abnormal hemoglobin, which may obviate the need for invasive diagnostic
procedures.

Low activities of the pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes in five
patients with Friedreich's ataxia.

Blass JP, Kark RA, Menon NK.

Since patients with Friedreich's ataxia appear to oxidize pyruvate slowly, we
measured the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in disrupted
fibroblasts from four patients with this syndrome and one patient with a clinical
variant. The activity was 43 +/- 4 per cent of that in 16 controls (mean +/-
S.E.M., P less than 0.001). The activity of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase
complex was also lower in the patients' cells than in those of controls (50 +/- 2
per cent, P less than 0.001). However, the activity of cytochrome-c oxidase was
normal (126 +/- 43 per cent of controls). Mixing experiments gave no evidence of 
soluble enzyme inhibitors or activators, and the addition of excess substrate or 
cofactor did not ameliorate the deficiencies. White blood cells from one of the
patients had low activities of both complexes. Mutations of these dehydrogenase
complexes occur in some patients with Friedreich's ataxia and lead to abnormally 
low activity of an enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Massive resection and allograft transplantation in the treatment of malignant
bone tumors.

Mankin HJ, Fogelson FS, Thrasher AZ, Jaffer F.

Nineteen massive resections and allograft transplantations have been performed
for malignant or aggressive bone tumors. Allograft procurment technic uses
freezing of the segment to decrease immunogenicity of the bony portion and
glycinerization of the cartilage to maintain chondrocyte viability during
freezing and thawing. Fifteen Fifteen of the patients have been followed for an
average of almost two years and were evaluated for early results by serial
follow-up studies, including clinical, laboratoy, x-ray and scan data. Despite
numerous complications (related to both tumor and operation) none have
metastases, local recurrence, or major functional impairment except for two whose
grafts became infected. We conclude that, although still experimental, allograft 
replacement may in the future serve as an important approach to certain
neoplastic conditions of bones and joints.

Correction of the permeability defect in hereditary stomatocytosis by dimethyl
adipimidate.

Mentzer WC, Lubin BH, Emmons S.

The effect of imidoesters on the extraordinarily increased cation permeability of
hereditary stomatocytes was evaluated in erythrocytes from a splenectomized boy
with persistent hemolytic anemia. Reaction of stomatocytes with dimethyl
adipimidate reduced ouabain-associated potassium loss from 15 to 1.7 and sodium
gain from 22 to 2.5 meq per liter of red cells per hours. Red-cell volume, cation
concentration, and deformability, previously abnormal, rapidly became normal
after stomatocytes were reacted with dimethyl adipimidate. Instead of
stomatocytes, normal red cells and target cells were noted. The survival
(half-time) of stomatocytes treated with 51Cr-labeled dimethyl adipimidate
infused into rats rendered tolerant to human erythorocytes by pretreatment with
ethyl palmitate and cobra-venom factor was double that of untreated stomatocytes.
Chemical modification of the defect in vitro allowed stomatocytes to regain many 
properites of normal erythrocytes and favorably influenced the subsequent
survival of these cells in vivo.

Correction of severe combined immunodeficiency by fetal liver cells.

Buckley RH, Whisnant KJ, Schiff RI, Gilbertsen RB, Huang AT, Platt MS.

As an alternative to bone-marrow transplantation, two infants with severe
combined immunodeficiency who had no histocompatible donors were given
intraperitoneal infusions of fresh liver cells from fetuses of eight and nine to 
10 weeks. Transient graft-versus-host disease began at 42 and 52 days,
respectively. Both infants had rises in T cells and declines in B cells by three 
months. No functional immunologic improvement occurred in the first infant, who
died of pulmonary disease 10 months later. Clinical and functional immunologic
improvement occurred in the other, who is now 19 months after transplantation.
Lymphocyte responses to phytohemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were noted by
three months, to concanavalin A by five months, and to allogeneic cells by eight 
months. Delayed cutaneous responsiveness to candida developed and IgM became
norma. IgA and IgG remained low. Chimerism was demonstrated by a donor marker
chromosome in metaphases from recipient lymphocytes. Fetal liver cells therefore 
reversed the immunodeficiency.

Diffuse pulmonary injury associated with gold treatment.

Winterbauer RH, Wilske KR, Wheelis RF.

Two patients had diffuse, reversible pulmonary injury possibly owing to gold
sodium thiomalate treatment: a 32-year-old woman with chronic inflammatory
arthritis compatible with seronegative rheumatoid arthritis and a 32-year-old man
with shoulder arthralgia. The patients had received 420 mg and 325 mg of gold
sodium thiomalate, respectively. Cough and dyspnea began in the seventh and fifth
weeks of therapy, respectively. In both patients x-ray study showed bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates, with no evidence of pleural disease. The woman had no
other manifestations of hypersensitivity to gold. The man had exfoliative
dermatitis fever and anemia. Lung biopsies from both patients revealed
lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrating the alveolar septa and interstitial
fibrosis. The woman improved slowly during four months after discontinuation of
therapy. Pulmonary symptoms recurred after additional gold therapy, and again
resolved when gold was discontinued. The man, treated with prednisone, showed
prompt remission and remains will without medication.

Vitamin A transport in human vitamin A toxicity.

Smith FR, Goodman DS.

The plasma retinol transport system was studied in three patients with chronic
hypervitaminosis A. The toxic state in each was associated with increased plasma 
concentrations of total vitamin A, and particularly of retinyl esters. The
concentrations of plasma retinol-binding protein and prealbumin were, in
contrast, non to retinol-binding protein. These limited clinical data support
conclusions from detailed studies with hypervitaminotic rats, which suggest that 
vitamin A toxicity occurs when excessive amounts of vitamin A are presented to
cell membranes in association with plasma lipoproteins, rather than specifically 
bound to retinol-binding protein. Retinol-binding protein may not only regulate
the supply of retinol to tissues but also protect tissues from the surface-active
properties of the vitamin.

Reversal of advanced digoxin intoxication with Fab fragments of digoxin-specific 
antibodies.

Smith TW, Haber E, Yeatman L, Butler VP Jr.

Purified Fab fragments of ovine digoxin-specific antibodies reversed severe
digoxin intoxication in a patient who had taken 22.5 mg of the drug with suicidal
intent. Atrioventricular block with extreme bradycardia was temporarily managed
by pacing, but progressive, intractable hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 8.7 meq 
per liter) with increasing pacing threshold and progressive intraventricular
conduction delay was controlled only after infusion of 1100 mg of Fab. Sinus
rhythm returned 10 minutes after completion of Fab infusion. Within five hours,
the serum potassium concentration fell to 4.0 meq per liter. Free digoxin
concentrations in serum fell sharply to undetectable levels, whereas total serum 
digoxin concentration concomitantly increased 12-fold. Renal excretion of digoxin
bound to Fab was documented. Reversal of toxicity was not accompanied by
hemodynamic instability, and antibodies to sheep Fab fragments were not detected 
in the patient's serum after treatment. Thus, purified digoxin-specific Fab
fragments are capable of rapid reversal of advanced digoxin toxicity.

The syndromes of insulin resistance and acanthosis nigricans. Insulin-receptor
disorders in man.

Kahn CR, Flier JS, Bar RS, Archer JA, Gorden P, Martin MM, Roth J.

In six patients with acanthosis nigricans variable degrees of glucose
intolerance, hyperinsulinemia and marked resistance to exogenous insulin were
found. Studies of insulin receptors on circulating monocytes suggest that the
insulin resistance in these patients was due to a marked decrease in insulin
binding to its membrane receptors. When these patients were fasted, there was a
fall in plasma insulin but no increase in insulin binding, suggesting that the
receptor defect was not secondary to the hyperinsulinemia. The clinical features 
shared by these cases and several similar ones previously reported may be divided
into two unique clinical syndromes: Type A, a syndrome in younger females with
signs of virilization or accelerated growth, in whom the receptor defect may be
primary, and Type B, a syndrome in older females with signs of an immunologic
disease, in whom circulating antibodies to the insulin receptor are found.

Interaction of quinidine with anticonvulsant drugs.

Data JL, Wilkinson GR, Nies AS.

Drug-disposition studies of orally administered quinidine in four normal healthy 
volunteers indicated that phenobarbital and phenytoin reduced the half-life of
quinidine by approximately 50 per cent (control, 3.0 to 6.1 hours, and with
anticonvulsants, 1.6 to 2.6 hours). Alterations of similar magnitude in the
apparent plasma clearance of quinidine after oral administration (control 20.0 to
32.0 liters per hour; with anticonvulsant 44.0 to 94.0 liters per hour) suggest
that this effect is probably due to an increase in the rate of metabolism of
quinidine, although decreased absorption cannot be entirely ruled out. In two
index patients the concomitant use of anticonvulsant drugs resulted in inadequate
blood levels of quinidine with standard dosages of that drug.

Basis for recurring ventricular fibrillation in the absence of coronary heart
disease and its management.

Lown B, Temte JV, Reich P, Gaughan C, Regestein Q, Hal H.

A 39-year-old man twice experienced ventricular fibrillation and exhibited
numerous ventricular premature beats. Coronary arteries were normal, and no
impaired cardiac function was found upon catheterization. Evidence was adduced
that the ventricular premature beats were related to higher nervous activity. The
patient had serious psychiatric problems; the ventricular premature beats were
provoked by psychophysiologic stress, increased during REM sleep, were reduced by
meditation, and were controlled by beta-adrenergic blockade, phenytoin and
digitalization. We conclude that psychologic and neurophysiologic factors may
predispose to life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia in the absence of organic heart
disease. Effective management of the recurrent ventricular arrhythmia involved;
acute drug testing for assessing antiarrhythmic efficacy; use of programmed
trendscription to provide on-line information on drug action; a treatment program
involving more than one agent; and use of measures to reduce sympathetic nervous 
activity.

Adult-onset acid maltase deficiency. Morphologic and biochemical abnormalities
reproduced in in cultured muscle.

Askanas V, Engel WK, DiMauro S, Brooks BR, Mehler M.

We established muscle-tissue cultures from biopsy of a patient with adult-onset
acid maltase deficiency. Morphologically and biochemically, the newly grown
fibers of the cultured muscle showed the same abnormalities as those of the
biopsied muscle. Light microscopy showed multiple vacuoles filled with
acid-phosphatase-positive material; on ultrastructural examination there was
abnormal accumulation of glycogen in membrane-bound sacs (secondary lysosomes),
some of which also contained dark membranous of homogeneous material. Acid
maltase (pH 4.0), a lysosomal enzyme, was undetectable in either cultured or
biopsied muscle by maltose hydrolysis, whereas acid phosphatase, also a lysosomal
enzyme, was increased in both sources of muscle cells. Cultured muscle fibers
demonstrate the same morphologic and biochemical abnormalities characteristic of 
biopsied muscle, supporting the concept of a biochemically distinct primary
myopathy in man.

Dihydrofolate reductase deficiency causing megaloblastic anemia in two families.

Tauro GP, Danks DM, Rowe PB, Van der Weyden MB, Schwarz MA, Collins VL, Neal BW.

To determine the cause of severe megaloblastosis detected at birth and at four
weeks in two unrelated infants their bone marrow and liver cells were studied.
Both patients had abnormal deoxyuridine suppression tests, corrected to normal by
5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid. Liver-cell homogenate from one patient had a
previously undetectable level of dihydrofolate reductase restored to normal by
high cation concentration in the assay. Activity of the liver-cell homogenate
from the other patient, which was one quarter of the normal level, was restored
to only half normal activity by high cation concentration. Dihydrofolic acid
reductase deficiency prevents this conversion of folic acid to tetrahydrofolic
acid; the enzyme activity appears to differ in each patient. A satisfactory
clinical response in both patients followed parenteral therapy with 5-formyl
tetrahydrofolic acid. One sibling in each family died of a similar illness.
Autosomal recessive inheritance is probable.

Neuroblastoma in father and son.

A growing literature supports the concept that some cases of neuroblastoma are
hereditary. To this we add the first known case, to our knowledge, of
neuroblastoma in a parent and child. Various factors, such as the remarkable
tendency for this tumor to regress spontaneously, as well as its frequent fatal
outcome, have reduced the number of observed familial cases. It is important that
siblings and progeny of patients with neuroblastoma be examined to detect
possible subclinical neuroblastoma.

Secretory component deficiency. A disorder of the IgA immune system.

Strober W, Krakauer R, Klaeveman HL, Reynolds HY, Nelson DL.

We studied a 15-year-old boy with chronic intestinal candidiasis who had normal
serum IgA levels without IgA in his secretions. There was an elevated number of
peripheral blood lymphocytes bearing surface IgA. In addition, the lymphocytes
cultured in vitro with pokeweed mitogen produced IgA as well as other
immunoglubulins. Despite this evidence of normal IgA synthetic capacity, the
patient had greatly diminished levels of IgA in the saliva and jejunal fluid,
and, as estimated by 14C-L-leucine incorporation, could not synthesize IgA
locally at intestinal-mucosal sites. Finally, the patient had no detectable free 
secretory component in saliva or jejunal fluid in contrast to normal persons and 
to patients with IgA deficiency. The basis of this disorder is probably a defect 
in the homing of IgA precursor cells to secretory sites or in the selective
proliferation/differentiation of IgA cells at such sites.

Role of hyperkalemia in the metabolic acidosis of isolated hypoaldosteronism.

Szylman P, Better OS, Chaimowitz C, Rosler A.

We studied the relative importance of hyperkalemia and mineralocorticoid
deficiency in the metabolic acidosis of a patient with proved isolated
hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism and moderate kidney failure. The hyperkalemia and
acidosis were severe in relation to the slight azotemia. Despite the systemic
acidosis and urinary pH of 4.9, urinary ammonium excretion was distinctly
blunted. Correction of the hyperkalemia by potassium-sodium exchange resin alone 
resolved the acidosis and restored the previously diminished urinary ammonium
excretion to normal. Administration of mineralocorticoids only partially
corrected the hyperkalemia and the acidosis. Hyperkalemia by itself, rather than 
hypoaldosteronism per se, caused the acidosis in this patient. Hyperkalemia
apparently suppresses urinary ammonium excretion and thus interferes with urinary
acidification.

Prinzmetal's variant angina. Coronary arteriogram and left ventriculogram during 
angina attack induced by methacholine.

Endo M, Hirosawa K, Kaneko N, Hase K, Inoue Y.

Recently, in Prinzmetal's variant angina, many cases with normal coronary
arteries have been reported. The anginal attacks frequently relapse after
aortocoronary bypass grafting. It is frequently possible to induce an anginal
attack by parasympathomimetic agents such as methacholine and pilocarpine. In
this study, methacholine (0.13 mg per kilogram) was injected subcutaneously in
three cases of this disease to induce an angina attack, and coronary arteriograms
and left ventriculograms were recorded. In all cases a coronary arterial spasm
corresponding to the site of the ST-segment elevation in the electrocardiogram
was observed. Complete occlusion due to the spasm was observed even in the normal
coronary artery. Asynergy was seen in the left ventricular wall corresponding to 
the site of the ST-segment elevation in the electrocardiogram.

Myeloma with xanthoderma due to an IgG lambdamonoclonal anti-flavin antibody.

Farhangi M, Osserman EF.

When yellow skin and yellow hair developed in an elderly patient with multiple
myeloma, we ruled out the usual causes of such pigmentation but identified a
monoclonal IgGlambda (lgGGar) with anti-flavin antibody activity. Purified IgGGar
was bright yellow, and the acid-dissociated chromophore was identified as
riboflavin by chromatography and absorption spectroscopy. Native IgGGar contained
1.45 moles of flavin per mole of IgG, and increased to 2 moles with addition of
riboflavin to saturation. The flavin was localized to the Fab fragment and was
bound to IgGGar with high affinity. IgGGar showed strongest affinities for
riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide, and lower
affinities for dinitrophenyl derivatives and naphthoquinone. The demonstration of
hapten bound to the circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin in this case suggests
the possibility of bound but colorless haptens on other myeloma proteins as well 
as on normal immunoglobulins.

The value of a histamine H2-receptor antagonist in the management of patients
with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

Richardson CT, Walsh JH.

Inhibition of acid secretion by an H2-receptor antagonist (metiamide) was
assessed in three patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Metiamide (200 or
300 mg) inhibited acid secretion transiently (2 1/2 hours) by 85 to 100 per cent 
in all patients. Although anticholinergic drugs alone inhibited acid secretion by
only 0 to 35 per cent in these patients, the combination of metiamide and
anticholinergic markedly prolonged the inhibitory effect of metiamide. Total
gastrectomy was refused by one patient, and was impossible in another; both were 
treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for five and 10 months. A third
patient was treated with metiamide and anticholinergic for three weeks in
preparation for total gastrectomy. Ulcer pain and diarrhea disappeared, and each 
gained weight. H2-receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of some
patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

abnormalities of proximal-tubule transport mechanisms (Fanconi syndrome),
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and distal renal tubular acidosis. Seventeen of
the 19 urinary amino acid levels measured were elevated. Uric acid and phosphate 
clearances were greater than 60 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, of the
simultaneous inulin clearance. When water deprivation was coupled with
vasopressin administration, the maximum urinary concentration observed was 384
mOsm per kilogram of water. During ammonium-chloride loading, the level of
hydrogen-ion concentration in the urine remained less than 100 times that in the 
blood. Kappa light-chain excretion was 149 mg per 24 hours. It appears that the
concurrence of proximal tubular dysfunction, distal tubular dysfunction and
light-chain proteinuria represents a distinct syndrome, which we call "combined
light-chain nephropathy." Available evidence indicates that excessive light-chain
production with subsequent filtration, reabsorption and catabolism, causes the
complex tubular dysfunctions observed.

Nephrosis and papillary necrosis after pyelonephritis.

Hernandez GV, King AS, Needle MA.

We present a case of nephrotic syndrome complicating acute pyelonephritis in a
45-year-old man. His first attack of acute bacterial pyelonephritis had two
unusual features: transient nephrotic syndrome and chronic recurrent episodes of 
papillary necrosis. The former, which lasted for two weeks, was characterized by 
edema, excretion of 7.7 g of urinary protein per 24 hours and hypoproteinemia
(1.8 g per 100 ml). A percutaneous renal biopsy two weeks after the height of the
nephrotic state showed normal glomeruli by light and electron microscopy and
immunohistologic studies. Interstitial changes were noted. Over two years the
patient has passed approximately 50 fragments, characterized as necrotic tissue
containing tubular structures. He has no evidence of diabetes mellitus,
urinary-tract obstruction or ureteral reflux, analgesic abuse or atypical
vasculitis. He is afebrile but has recurrent bacteriuria despite antibiotics.
This case demonstrates that acute pyelonephritis must be added to the list of
diseases causing the nephrotic state.

Immunologic components of hypersensitivity reactions to cromolyn sodium.

Sheffer AL, Rocklin RE, Goetzl EJ.

Manifestations of cellular and humoral hypersensitivity to cromolyn sodium were
sought in six asthmatic patients suspected of having acute (three cases) or
subacute (three cases) adverse reactions to cromolyn inhalation. Lymphocytes from
all patients produced migration inhibition factor (MIF), and those from four
patients incorporated increased amounts of 3H-thymidine in response to cromolyn
in vitro. Lymphocytes from four of nine cromolyn-tolerant asthmatics demonstrated
increased 3H-thymidine incorporation but none showed MIF production, whereas
lymphocytes from normal subjects failed to react to cromolyn in either assay. Two
of three patients with subacute reactions had increased serum binding of
3H-cromoglycate which was attributable to the IgG fraction. Thus although
patients tolerating cromolyn therapy may demonstrate lymphocyte transformation in
vitro, only those with clinically apparent adverse reactions produce lymphocyte
MIF or possess serum-binding activity for the drug.

Cyproheptadine-induced remission of Cushing's disease.

Krieger DT, Amorosa L, Linick F.

Experimental evidence suggests a central-nervous-system origin of Cushing's
disease and a role for serotonin in the regulation of ACTH release. The efficacy 
of cyproheptadine therapy, therefore, was studied in three patients with such
disease. Administration of 24 mg daily over a period of three to six months was
associated with prompt and sustained clinical and laboratory remission. Lessening
of the physical manifestations of hypercorticism occurred, together with marked
improvement in muscular weakness. Urinary corticosteroid excretion and cortisol
secretory rate returned to normal. The urinary corticosteroid response to
dexamethasone (2 mg per day) became normal; a paradoxical increase followed 8 mg 
per day. Abnormal circadian periodicity of plasma cortisol concentrations
persisted. Return of normal amounts of Stage III to IV sleep occurred in the one 
patient so studied, who previously had markedly decreased periods of these
stages. Discontinuance of therapy in one patient was associated with return of
laboratory evidence of hypercorticism.

Treatment of hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism with metabolites of 
vitamin D: evidence for impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1
alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.

Kooh SW, Fraser D, DeLuca HF, Holick MF, Belsey RE, Clark MB, Murray TM.

In hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism, pharmacologic doses of
vitamin D correct hypocalcemia, but the mechanism is unknown. In two children
with hypoparathyroidism and one with pseudohypoparathyroidism we tested the
hypothesis that in these conditions there is a defect in synthesis of 1
alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the principal active metabolite of vitamin D. In
both conditions, minute doses of the metabolite (0.04 to 0.08 mug per kilogram of
body weight per day) quickly corrected hypocalcemia and increased intestinal
calcium absorption. On the other hand, the effective dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
to maintain normocalcemia was 3 to 4 mug per kilogram per day in the two
conditions. Thus, the dosage ratio of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1
alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 approximated 100:1. By contrast this ratio was
approximately 3:1 in two infants with vitamin D deficiency, a condition in which 
optimal metabolism of vitamin D would be expected. These findings suggest an
impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in
both hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism.

Phenylketonuria due to a deficiency of dihydropteridine reductase.

Kaufman S, Holtzman NA, Milstien S, Butler LJ, Krumholz A.

The onset of neurologic symptoms in a child who had markedly elevated blood
phenylalanine levels during the first two weeks of life and who was promptly
treated with a low phenylalanine diet, with excellent control of serum
phenylalanine levels, suggested that this child had an unusual form of
phenylketonuria. In assays of the components of the phenylalanine hydroxylating
system (open liver biopsy at 14 months), the activity of phenylalanine
hydroxylase was 20 per cent of the average normal adult value. By contrast, no
dihydropteridine reductase activity was detected in the patient's liver, brain or
cultured skin fibroblasts. Since dihydropteridine reductase is also essential for
the biosynthesis of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, disturbed
neurotransmitter function may be responsible for the patient's neurologic
deterioration. On the basis of these results, assay of reductase in cultured skin
fibroblasts may be advisable in the initial diagnosis of phenylketonuria.

Use of platelet aggregometry in selection of compatible platelet donors.

Wu KK, Hoak JC, Thompson JS, Koepke JA.

To determine if platelet aggregometry was useful in selecting compatible platelet
donors, six patients who had become refractory to random platelets were studied. 
Serum from the patient was added to citrated platelet-rich plasma from the
prospective donor in a standard aggregometry system. Serial aggregometry studies 
revealed no platelet aggregation unless the refractory state had been reached. At
that time positive aggregation occurred only between the poorly matched pairs. A 
correlation between platelet aggregation and HL-A histocompatibility was noted.
Family members with negative aggregation were selected as donors, and their
platelets were able to provide consistently satisfactory increments in the
platelet count of the recipient who was refractory to random donors. In contrast,
platelets from family members who exhibited positive aggregation failed to do so.
These findings suggest that platelet aggregometry can be used to select
compatible platelet donors.

Massachusetts Medical Society. Committee on Maternal Welfare. Chorioamnionitis
complicated by an intrauterine device.

Jewett JF.

PIP: A case report of chorioanmionitis complicated by an IUD and resulting in
death is presented. A 27-year-old para 2 conceived during the amenorrhea of
lactation despite an IUD which was inserted 6 weeks postpartum. The identifying
filament was not seen when the patient was examined in the first trimester, but
the pregnancy was uneventful until spontaneous rupture of the membranes at 22
weeks. The patient was sent home after amniotic-fluid leakage was confirmed. She 
returned within 24 hours with an elevated temperature. Cultures revealed
Escherichia coli and the syndrome of gram-negative endotoxin became evident. A
macerated fetus and the placenta were delivered but not the IUD. The patient was 
treated with oxygen and chloramphenicol. Surgical intervention was instituted 26 
hours after admission and 20 hours postpartum. Panhysterectomy was performed.
Homeostasis was reestablished but the patient remained cyanotic and hypoxic.
Death from respiratory failure occurred on the 12th day. The author stated that
simple adherence to established obstetric principles could have prevented this
death, especially the serious error to send this patient home after
amniotic-fluid leakage was confirmed. Other possible errors are discussed.

Septic induced abortion.

Jewett JF.

PIP: A case of septic induced abortion in a 15-year-old girl referred to the
hospital as a pediatric patient with the provisional diagnosis of meningococcemia
is reported. The patient was admitted in shock, cyanotic, and vasoconstricted.
Pertinent comments by the nurses that the patient admitted coitus 12 to 14 weeks 
previously and followed by amenorrhea, were apparently ignored. The 1st
gynecologic consultant was called after the patient experienced severe cramps and
passage of part of a placenta. He recommended intravenous oxytocin and curettage,
but this advice was not followed because the hospital pharmacy did not stock
oxytocin and because the administration would not permit curettage on a child.
Dilation and curettage was performed after transfer to a general hospital. The
patient died 6 weeks after admission, and the pathologist's final summary noted
that extensive pneumonia together with organizing thrombi suggest that the
patient may have thrown septic emboli very early in the course of her disease. It
is concluded that errors and omissions were disastrous, but even more
reprehensible was the failure of residents to credit nurses' notes or follow
consultants' recommendations which clearly pointed all along to the correct
diagnosis. Finally, when the patient aborted in bed, the urgency of intervention 
was not recognized and the time which was her last chance for survival was lost.

Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Weekly clinicopathological
exercises. Case 47-1972.

[No authors listed]

PIP: A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of dyspnea. 15
years previously biopsy of an enlarged left cervical lymph node revealed
giant-follicle lymphoma; the patient received radiation. 7 years before a right
radical mastectomy was performed for an adenocarcinoma of the breast; there were 
metastases to several anxillary lymph nodes. 4 years before, a malignant lymphoma
was discovered again and radiation successfully given. 5 months before admission 
there was an onset of severe dyspnea. Upon admission, the temperature was 36.9
degrees C, pulse 100, and respirations 32. Blood pressure was 120/70. Oxygen,
prednisone, furosemide, chlordiazepoxide, and morphine were administered. The
woman died the 2nd day. Clinical diagnoses showed that the woman died of
carcinoma of the breast with metastoses to mediastinal lymph nodes, the chest
wall and the lungs, and that lymphoma was inactive. Radiation may have caused the
late malignant tumor. A late radiation-induced complication may be another
malignant tumor. It is noted that radiation therapy may be a calculated risk in
some cases.

Idiopathic periosteal hyperostosis with dysproteinemia. A new clinical entity.

Goldbloom RB(1), Stein PB, Eisen A, McSheffrey JB, Brown BS, Wiglesworth FW.

Author information: 
(1)Paediatric Medical Service, Department of Radiology, Montreal Children's
Hospital, Quebec.

Two unrelated children, suffering from a transient illness characterized by
fever, bone pain and tenderness, inability to walk, x-ray evidence of
subperiosteal new bone formation and dysproteinemia, are described. In both
children the onset followed a respiratory infection. The fever lasted for about
three weeks in 1 patient and two months in the other. As fever subsided, the
x-ray evidence of periosteal hyperostosis gradually disappeared, and the
electrophoretic pattern of the serum proteins returned to normal. Tibial biopsy
in 1 patient showed subperiosteal new bone formation of the right-angled type,
with no inflammation and with the presence of mucinous edema. Plasma cells were
unusually abundant in the bone marrow. The serum protein disturbance was
characterized by hypoalbuminemia and striking elevation of the alpha2 and gamma
globulins. Detailed serum protein studies performed in 1 patient showed the
hypergammaglobulinemia to be due primarily to an increase in the IgG fraction. No
etiologic agent was identified, and recovery was complete in both patients. The
entity does not appear to have been described previously.

Isoproterenol in the treatment of shock due to bacteremia with gram-negative
pathogens.

Kardos GG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Medical Services, San Francisco General Hospital, USA.

A series of 12 patients with shock that followed bacteremia due to gram-negative 
pathogens is presented, and a case is reported. The hemodynamic alterations that 
occur in such patients are discussed. Initial therapy includes intravascular
volume expansion and administration of glucocorticoids and antibiotic drugs;
subsequent therapy, if necessary, includes administration of metaraminol and
isoproterenol respectively. The problems encountered with this method of
treatment are described. The use of isoproterenol (2.5 to 5 mg. in 500 ml. of 5
per cent dextrose in water administered intravenously at a rate of 0.5 to 2.0 ml.
per minute) is suggested to correct the hemodynamic alterations usually present
and permit further expansion of circulating blood volume with reduced risk of
acute circulatory overload. Clinical use of this drug is recommended because of
its positive ionotropic effect on the myocardium (beta-adrenergic stimulation)
and direct peripheral arterial vasodilator effect (alpha-adrenergic blockade)
that act to correct the hemodynamic alterations usually present in man in
endotoxin shock.

A case of pyridoxine-responsive anemia with hypolipidemia and hypocholesterolemia

Carotid thrombosis due to intraoral trauma. An unusual complication of a common
childhood accident.

Comment in
    N Engl J Med. 1966 Apr 7;274(14):799.

The cases of a child and an adolescent in whom internal-carotid-artery thrombosis
followed non-penetrating trauma to the paratonsillar area from objects held in
the mouth are reported, and are discussed together with 10 similar cases
collected from the literature. Although the incidence of this complication of an 
accident almost unique to childhood is unknown, 2 out of 15 children in a
consecutive series with acute hemiplegia had a history of such trauma. This
suggests that specific inquiry concerning such injuries should be made in any
child with an acute, focal neurologic lesion. Physicians seeing patients with
paratonsillar injuries should be aware that neurologic complications may ensue.
As a rule, there is a period of up to twenty-four hours from the time of injury
to the onset of neurologic symptoms; this may cause confusion with an
intracranial hematoma in patients with a history of prior or associated head
injuries. The diagnosis of internal-carotid-artery occlusion can be proved
clinically only by angiography, which should be performed before therapy is
undertaken. One third of the children with internal-carotid-artery occlusion
after intraoral trauma died; the constant pathological finding was extension of
the thrombus distally into the major intracranial arteries, with massive
infarction of the hemisphere. A theory of the pathogenesis of occlusion of the
internal carotid artery after nonpenetrating trauma is presented. A plan of
therapy based on this hypothesis is considered.

A case of exophthalmos, and ectopic hyperplastic thyroid tissue occurring at the 
base of the tongue, in the subhyoid area and in the lateral thyroid lobe is
presented. The frequent misdiagnosis of ectopic thyroid tissue as a
thyroglossal-duct cyst should make the surgeon cautiously evaluate each case
individually. Selective use of scintigrams with I131 is helpful in the
preoperative diagnosis to prevent inadvertent excision of a patient's only
remaining thyroid tissue.

Hyper-beta-alaninemia associated with beta-aminoaciduria and
gamma-aminobutyricaciduaia, somnolence and seizures.

Scriver CR(1), Pueschel S, Davies E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec.

Hyper-beta-alaninemia was found in a somnolent, convulsing infant.
Hyper-beta-aminoaciduria (beta-ala, betaAIB and taurine) was also observed,
varying directly with plasma beta-alanine concentration. The beta-aminoaciduria
is explained by the interaction between beta-alanine and a specific
cellular-transport system with preference for beta-amino compounds.
Gamma-aminobutyricaciduria was also observed, its excretion being independent of 
beta-alanine levels. Dietary modifications, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid and
antibiotic therapy were not beneficial. Post-mortem tissues had elevated levels
of beta-alanine and carnosine; GABA levels in brain were probably elevated for
the age of the patient. A proposed block in beta-alanine-alpha-ketoglutarate
transaminase would expand the free beta-alanine pool, thus increasing tissue
carnosine. beta-Alanine is a central-nervous-system depressant. Associated
inhibition of GABA transaminase and displacement of GABA from
central-nervous-system binding sites would produce GABAuria and convulsions.
