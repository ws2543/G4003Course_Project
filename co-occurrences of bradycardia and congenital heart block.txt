RATIONALE: Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an infrequent disease caused by 
transplacental maternal autoantibodies. The most common effects of NLE include
cutaneous involvement and congenital heart block (CHB), although it might involve
multiple organs, such as the liver, lungs, blood, and nervous or digestive
systems. Izmirly PM1 and Tonello et al recently reported cutaneous manifestations
of neonatal lupus and risk of subsequent CHB. The most serious complication of
NLE is complete atrioventricular (AV) block.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We experienced 2 cases of NLE that were diagnosed in the past
year in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. These cases showed 2 different clinical
spectrums (CHB, multisystemic effects). One case was a 32-week pregnant woman
with combined liver damage and fever, and her fetus was premature due to
bradycardia and pericardial effusion. The second case was a young pregnant woman 
who had systemic lupus erythematosus for 2 years and had been taking
methylprednisolone and hydroxychloroquine for a long time since her illness. When
prenatal testing at 28 weeks of pregnancy showed that the fetus had CHB, the
mother began taking dexamethasone.
DIAGNOSIS: The first case was diagnosed as NLE with CHB after birth, while the
second was diagnosed as NLE with CHB, ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect
when she was born at 34 weeks.
INTERVENTIONS: Both of 2 cases were treated with steroids, intravenous
immunoglobulin, and a diuretic. But the second case was treated with isoprenaline
in addition to the above.
OUTCOMES: Both of the infants was followed up and found to be clinically normal. 
During the clinic follow-up of the first case, the 8-month-old infant was still
asymptomatic with normal growth and development. Her heart rate fluctuated from
40 to 90 beats/minute.
LESSONS: Autoimmune CHB is a severe, potentially life-threatening disorder
associated with passive transfer of maternal anti-Sjogren's syndrome A/Ro and
anti-Sjogren's syndrome B/La autoantibodies. Mothers who are positive for these
autoantibodies are recommended to have serial echocardiography and obstetric
ultrasonography from the early second trimester. Newborns should be delivered at 
an early stage of gestation if there is evidence of pericardial effusion,
ascites, increasing ventricular ectopy, reduced ventricular shortening fraction, 
or AV valve regurgitation. Aggressive medical management after birth should be
coupled with pacemaker implantation in infants who do not respond to medical
therapies alone.

Fetal hydrops is a serious complication of immune-mediated congenital complete
atrioventricular block. We present the case of a fetus with severe hydrops and
profound bradycardia and an unusual favourable outcome. This case enhances the
importance of considering the contribution of ventricular ectopic beats to the
cardiac output when counselling and predicting outcome of complete heart block.

Cardiovascular Surgery Center and Research Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Congenital complete atrioventricular block without any structural
heart disease and anti-Ro/La negativity is very rare. Discordant complete
atrioventricular block, which is more frequently defined in the literature as an 
autoimmune mechanism, is much more rare in monozygotic twins.
CASE REPORT: The 26-year-old healthy mother had given birth in her first
spontaneous, uneventful pregnancy to monozygotic twins at week 35. While the
first twin's physical examination proved her to be normal with a pulse rate
consistent with her age, the second twin had a pulse rate of approximately 40
beats/minute.The patient was confirmed to have congenital complete
atrioventricular block.
CONCLUSION: Despite this case appears to be an isolated one, a discordant
complete atrioventricular block regression without any autoimmune evidence should
be included in the differential diagnosis of bradycardia in infants.

In Down syndrome, so far, has not been reported it's association with congenital 
heart block, this entity is rare and occurred in only 1% of mothers who have
systemic lupus erythematosus, the presence of anti-Ro antibodies cross the
placenta presenting neonatal lupus with skin lesions and congenital heart block, 
bradycardia, which is why we describe the following case. This is a new male end 
product of asymptomatic young mother, but serological birth with stigmata of Down
syndrome, birth presents congenital bradycardia rare manifestation abnormalities,
but common in children of mothers with lupus are initiated study protocol,
realizing you including laboratory tests and immunological studies cabinet as
electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, which gave tone to take the mother
immunological studies, being positive antiRo. We concluded that the risk of heart
block in a patient with Down syndrome is the same as for the general population.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is rare disorder that has a higher mortality when
associated with structural congenital heart defects. Very few cases have been
reported in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We present a case of complete CHB
associated with a complex congenital heart defect in a neonate in Cameroon. A
1-month-old neonate in Cameroon was referred for the evaluation of bradycardia.
The obstetrical ultrasound done during pregnancy revealed fetal bradycardia
without further evaluation. Clinical examination showed well a developed neonate 
with bradycardia at 62 beats/minute, and mild cyanosis with oxygen saturation at 
93% at room air. There were no signs of heart failure. Twelve lead
electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated a complete atrioventricular conduction block
with a junctional escape rhythm at 59/minute, left axis deviation and
bi-ventricular hypertrophy. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a complex
congenital heart disease with the following abnormalities: dextrocardia, complete
atrioventricular canal with a single atrium and mild atrioventricular valve
regurgitation and malposition of the great vessels with a posterior aorta and an 
anterior pulmonary artery. This case report highlights the challenges in the
diagnosis and management of complex CHBs in low resource settings. A properly
performed pregnancy follow-up with serial echocardiograms could aid in antenatal 
diagnosis and plan perinatal management when appropriate in order to optimize
outcome. This emphasizes the clinical value of high quality antenatal care and
proper screening.

BACKGROUND: Congenital complete heart block is a life-threatening condition which
is highly associated with autoimmune and connective tissue disorders. Presence of
maternal autoantibodies for associated conditions increases the risk of
delivering a child with congenital complete heart block, however, less than a
half of all women with such antibodies are symptomatic even after delivery.
Mortality rate is highest during the neonatal period (45 %) and about two-thirds 
of all cases will require permanent pacing at some point in their lives.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of isolated complete heart block in a
5-year-old HIV-free girl of African descent born to an HIV-infected woman with no
prior history of autoimmune disorders. She was referred to us with chief
complaints of recurrent syncopal attacks and effort intolerance since birth. A
physical examination was unremarkable except for her being small for her age
(body mass index 16.3 kg/m2) and bradycardia. Her vital signs were within
acceptable range with the exception of her pulse rate, which ranged between 22
and 34 beats/minute. An echocardiogram revealed a sinus bradycardia, otherwise a 
structurally normal heart. An electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular
dissociation in keeping with third-degree atrioventricular block. The child
underwent a permanent epicardial pacemaker insertion and has been symptom-free
following pacing.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its infrequency and life-threatening potential, patients
with congenital complete heart block have an excellent survival rate with timely 
diagnosis and intervention. An incidental detection of bradycardia in a fetus
during routine obstetrical ultrasound examination should increase the index of
suspicion for congenital complete heart block and warrant a screening for
associated maternal autoantibodies.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated the effects of maternal autoimmune disease and
fetal congenital heart block (CHB) on pregnancy outcomes in anti-Ro/SSA-positive 
women and assessed the population-based incidence of isolated CHB.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and ninety nine anti-Ro/SSA-positive
pregnancies were prospectively followed at our center (2000-2013). Seven fetuses 
developed atrioventricular block (AVB) II-III. In this period, another 13
anti-Ro/SSA-positive pregnancies were referred for fetal bradycardia,
subsequently diagnosed with AVB II-III. Cesarean section rates, gestational age, 
body measurements at birth, and the incidence of CHB in these 212 pregnancies
were analyzed in relation to fetal atrioventricular conduction and maternal
diagnosis and compared with data from the Medical Birth Registry on 352,104
pregnancies in the Stockholm County.
RESULTS: The prevalence of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and
primary Sjögren's syndrome and the outcomes at birth were similar in normal
conduction and AVB I cases. Only 1/20 AVB II-III cases (0/7 in the surveillance
group) had a mother diagnosed with SLE, compared with 73/192 in cases with normal
conduction or AVB I. Excluding cases with AVB II-III, SLE mothers more frequently
delivered by cesarean section (31% vs. 20%, p < 0.05) and had a higher incidence 
of preterm birth (13% vs. 5.8%, p < 0.05) than the county population. Both SLE
and primary Sjögren's syndrome mothers had a fourfold greater rate of
growth-retarded babies (10.11% vs. 2.2%, p < 0.001). The incidence of
autoantibody-related AVB II-III in Stockholm County was 1/23 300.
CONCLUSION: This study of CHB provides new information on the incidence of CHB
and outcome of pregnancy in anti-Ro/SSA-positive women, which has clinical
relevance when counseling rheumatic patients considering pregnancy.

Persistent fetal bradycardia in early pregnancy is a rare finding and indicates
towards congenital heart block. This is commonly associated with positive
maternal anti-Ro/anti-La antibodies. A case of an asymptomatic primigravida with 
persistent fetal bradycardia on routine antenatal ultrasound is reported with
special emphasis on its management options.

We present the sonographic features of a second-trimester fetus diagnosed with a 
bradyarrhythmia at 19 weeks' gestation. The mother carried a diagnosis of Sjögren
syndrome, including the presence of SSA and SSB antibodies. Ultrasound M-mode and
fetal echocardiogram revealed the etiology of the bradycardia to be a complete
fetal congenital heart block, likely due to transplacental passage of autoimmune 
anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies. Consequential to the congenital heart
block, the fetus developed hydrops fetalis at 21 weeks' gestational age. We
discuss the 2 major etiologies of congenital heart block and the implications in 
subsequent pregnancies.

A percutaneously implantable fetal pacemaker.

Zhou L, Vest AN, Chmait RH, Bar-Cohen Y, Pruetz J, Silka M, Zheng K, Peck R, Loeb
GE.

A miniaturized, self-contained pacemaker that could be implanted with a minimally
invasive technique would dramatically improve the survival rate for fetuses that 
develop hydrops fetalis as a result of congenital heart block. We are currently
validating a device that we developed to address this bradyarrhythmia.
Preclinical studies in a fetal sheep model are underway to demonstrate that the
device can be implanted via a minimally invasive approach, can mechanically
withstand the harsh bodily environment, can induce effective contractions of the 
heart muscle with an adequate safety factor, and can successfully operate for the
required device lifetime of three months using the previously-developed closed
loop transcutaneous recharging system.

Towards computational modelling of the human foetal electrocardiogram: normal
sinus rhythm and congenital heart block.

Author information: 
(1)School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK.

AIMS: We aim to engineer a computational model of propagation during normal sinus
rhythm in the foetal human heart, by modifying models for adult cardiac tissue to
match foetal electrocardiogram (fECG) characteristics. The model will be
partially validated by fECG data, and applied to explore possible mechanisms of
arrhythmogenesis in the foetal heart.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Foetal electrocardiograms have been recorded during
pregnancy, with P- and T-waves, and the QRS complex, identified by averaging and 
signal processing. Intervals of the fECG are extracted and used to modify
currently available human adult cardiomyocyte models. RR intervals inform models 
of the pacemaking cells by constraining their rate, the QT interval and its rate 
dependence constrain models of ventricular cells, and the width of the P-wave,
the QR and PR intervals constrain propagation times, conduction velocities, and
intercellular coupling. These cell models are coupled into a one-dimensional (1D)
model of propagation during normal sinus rhythm in the human foetal heart. We
constructed a modular, heterogeneous 1D model for propagation in the foetal
heart, and predicted the effects of reduction in L-type Ca(++) current. These
include bradycardia and atrioventricular conduction blocks. These may account
quantitatively for congenital heart block produced by positive IgG antibodies.
CONCLUSION: The fECG can be interpreted mechanistically and quantitatively by
using a simple computational model for propagation. After further validation, by 
clinical recordings of the fECG and the electrophysiological experiments on
foetal cardiac cells and tissues, the model may be used to predict the effects of
maternally administered pharmaceuticals on the fECG.

Research, SSKM Hospital, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.

Anti-Ro/La negative congenital heart block (CHB) is uncommon. We report one such 
case of CHB, with no associated structural heart disease or maternal
autoantibodies. The heart block reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously at two
weeks of age, and the patient remains in sinus rhythm at a one year followup.
Whether patients with antibody negative complete heart block have a different
clinical course is conjectural.

Doppler echocardiographic isovolumetric time intervals in diagnosis of fetal
blocked atrial bigeminy and 2:1 atrioventricular block.

Sonesson SE(1), Eliasson H, Conner P, Wahren-Herlenius M.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm,
Sweden.

OBJECTIVE: To distinguish between blocked atrial bigeminy (BB) and incomplete
atrioventricular block with 2:1 conduction (2:1 AVB) can be very difficult,
especially in the mid-term fetus. Making a correct diagnosis has important
clinical implications, as their prognosis and management differ markedly. Our
objective was to investigate whether analysis of isovolumetric time intervals
could improve Doppler echocardiography in differentiating these conditions.
METHODS: Sixteen fetuses with sustained BB or isolated 2:1 AVB, diagnosed at our 
tertiary center from 2002 to 2012, were reviewed retrospectively. Doppler
recordings of left ventricular in- and outflow, including mitral and aortic valve
movements, were used to measure isovolumetric contraction (ICT) and relaxation
(IRT) time intervals. ICT reference values obtained from 104 normal pregnancies
were used for comparison.
RESULTS: Ten fetuses had BB and six 2:1 AVB. Five of the AVB cases were anti-Ro
antibody positive and one had long QT syndrome (LQTS). ICT was systematically
shorter in BB than in antibody-mediated 2:1 AVB. Nine of 10 cases with BB had an 
ICT below -2 SD and the five with antibody-mediated 2:1 AVB had values at or
above +2 SD. All 15 fetuses with either BB or antibody-mediated AVB had an IRT of
< 70 ms, as opposed to a markedly prolonged IRT (105 ms) in the LQTS case.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of ICT can improve the differential diagnosis between BB 
and antibody-mediated 2:1 AVB. Fetuses with BB or antibody-mediated AVB are
unlikely to have IRT measurements exceeding 70 ms and, when this is observed,
LQTS should be considered a more likely diagnosis.

Antenatal and postnatal combined therapy for autoantibody-related congenital
atrioventricular block.

BACKGROUND: Autoantibody-related congenital heart block (CHB) is an autoimmune
condition in which trans placental passage of maternal autoantibodies cause
damage to the developing heart conduction system of the foetus.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Italian 31-year-old woman, in a good
clinical status, referred to our Centre at 26 weeks of her first pregnancy,
because of foetal bradycardia, found during routine foetal ultrasonography.
Foetal echocardiography revealed a 3rd degree CHB, without any anatomical
defects. Despite the mother was asymptomatic for autoimmune disease, anti-Ro/La
were searched for, because of the hypothesis of autoantibody-related CHB. High
title of maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies was found and diagnosis of an
autoantibody-related CHB was made. A combination treatment protocol of the mother
was started with oral betamethasone, plasmapheresis and IVIG. An emergency
C-section was performed at 32 + 3 weeks of gestation because of a non-reassuring 
cardiotocography pattern. A male newborn (BW 1515 g, NGA, Apgar 8-10) was treated
since birth with high-flow O2 for mild RDS. IVIG administration was started at
one week, and then every two weeks, until complete disappearance of maternal
antibodies from blood. Because of persistent low ventricular rate (<60/min),
seven days following birth, pacemaker implantation was performed. The baby is now
at 40th week with no signs of cardiac failure and free of any medications.
CONCLUSION: Up to date, no guidelines have been published for the treatment of
"in utero-CHB" and only anecdotal reports are available. It has been stated that 
a combination therapy protocol is effective in reversing a 2nd degree CHB, but
not for 3rd degree CHB. In cases of foetal bradycardia, weekly foetal
echocardiographic monitoring needs to be performed and in cases of 2nd degree CHB
and 3rd degree CHB maternal therapy could be suggested, as in our case, to avoid 
foetal heart failure. In cases of 3rd degree CHB often pacemaker implantation is 
needed.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare, passively acquired autoimmune disease,
caused by maternal autoantibodies. The most common manifestations are skin rash
and congenital heart block. Cutaneous manifestations may be present at birth, but
often develop within a few weeks after delivery. Congenital heart block may
present as bradycardia in utero or during physical examination at birth.
Approximately 40-60% of mothers are asymptomatic when the infants are diagnosed. 
We present a case of a child, born with erythematosus lesions in the face, scalp,
trunk, limbs and nodules/papules on the palmar and plantar surfaces. He also had 
hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Echocardiography showed hyperechoic
lesions on the anterior papilar muscle of the left ventricle and on the lateral
cusp of the tricuspid valve. The mother had unexplained fever and vasculitic
lesions in her hands and feet. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-SSa/Ro and
anti-SSb/La were positive in the mother and child, making the diagnosis of
neonatal lupus.

Autoimmune AV block is usually seen in association with autoimmune antibodies in 
mother that cross the placenta and damage the AV node of fetus. A 24-year-old
primigravida, diagnosed to have SLE, at 25 weeks period of gestation found to
have fetal bradycardia. Her ANA was moderately positive, SS-A (Ro) antibodies and
SS-B (La) antibodies were positive. Fetal ECHO showed no structural defect but
heart rate was 55 - 60 beats per minute. She was put on dexamethasone (4 mg/day).
She was lost on follow up and presented at term in emergency with labor pains and
fetal bradycardia, underwent a lower segment caesarean section. Baby underwent a 
temporary cardiac pacing within 10 hours of birth followed by permanent pacing on
day 3 of birth. Baby is doing well on follow up. Neonates with isolated
congenital heart block who are monitored antenatally and delivered in a planned
fashion at an institution capable of early pacing can have favorable outcomes.

atrioventricular block.

The incidence of congenital atrioventricular (AV) block is between 1 in 15,000
and 1 in 20,000 births. It may occur in isolation or as a consequence of
anomalous development of the conduction tissue in the context of a cardiac
malformation. In this review, we use the term congenital AV bock to describe
complete heart block when it is diagnosed in utero or at birth. The
pathophysiological process is believed to be due to immune-mediated injury of the
conduction system, which occurs as a result of transplacental passage of maternal
anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibodies. Many mothers are asymptomatic carriers, and less
than one-third have a preexisting diagnosis of a rheumatological disorder. The AV
block that develops months or years after birth probably occurs as a result of a 
different disease process that is poorly understood. The diagnosis of congenital 
AV block is usually confirmed by fetal echocardiography before birth and by
electrocardiography after birth. The implantation of a pacemaker is recommended
for symptomatic patients and for asymptomatic patients presenting with profound
bradycardia, left ventricular dysfunction, a wide QRS interval, or a prolonged QT
interval. It is now recognized that a subset of paced patients develop dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure, and therefore regular follow-up is important.
They are also at high risk of developing complications related to the presence of
intracardiac material as a result of prolonged exposure to pacing materials.
Future areas of research to minimize these risks include assessing the impact of 
alternative stimulation sites and the development of new cardiac stimulation
techniques.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical course and outcome of fetal sinus bradycardia
(SB) due to maternal antibody-induced sinus node dysfunction.
METHODS: We reviewed the maternal, prenatal, and postnatal findings of fetuses
with SB associated with elevated maternal anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies.
RESULTS: Of the 6 cases diagnosed prenatally, 3 had isolated SB persisting after 
birth and had a good prognosis. Three fetuses with SB and severe myocardial
involvement (congenital complete heart block and/or endocardial fibroelastosis)
succumbed in utero in spite of treatment. Postmortem histopathology in 1 fetus
showed inflammatory destruction of the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. SB was
detected incidentally in a 7-year-old girl. She had intermittent heart block with
progressive sinus arrest requiring permanent pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: Fetal SB associated with maternal autoantibodies may persist in
childhood, with a good prognosis in the absence of widespread cardiac
involvement.

Anti-Ro52 monoclonal antibodies specific for amino acid 200-239, but not other
Ro52 epitopes, induce congenital heart block in a rat model.

BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block (CHB) may develop in fetuses of women with
anti-Ro/La autoantibodies following placental transfer of maternal autoantibodies
and disruption of the fetal atrioventricular (AV) conduction system. Animal
models of CHB currently rely on immunisation or transfer of anti-Ro/La antibodies
purified from mothers of children with CHB, which does not allow precise
identification of the disease-inducing antibody specificity.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of different anti-Ro52 monoclonal antibodies 
to induce cardiac electrophysiological abnormalities in vivo and affect the
calcium homoeostasis of cardiomyocytes in vitro.
METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies recognising different domains of Ro52 were
generated and injected into pregnant rats, and ECG was recorded on newborn pups. 
Cultures of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were established to assess the effect of 
the different anti-Ro52 monoclonal antibodies on calcium homoeostasis.
RESULTS: First-degree AV block and bradycardia developed after maternal transfer 
of antibodies specific for amino acids 200-239 of Ro52 (p200), while pups exposed
to antibodies targeting N- or C-terminal epitopes of Ro52 did not show any
electrocardiogram abnormalities. Addition of an anti-p200 antibody to cultured
cardiomyocytes induced calcium dyshomoeostasis in a time- and dose-dependent
manner, while addition of other Ro52 antibodies had no effect.
CONCLUSION: These data for the first time show unambiguously that antibodies
specific for amino acids 200-239 of Ro52 can induce cardiac conduction defects in
the absence of other autoantibodies, and may therefore be the main initiators of 
cardiac pathology in the pool of anti-Ro52 antibodies in mothers of children with
CHB.

OBJECTIVES: To describe the experience with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
support for intractable primary arrhythmias in newborns and infants.
DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: A tertiary care pediatric hospital.
PATIENTS: Patients younger than 1 yr supported with extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation for primary cardiac arrhythmias were identified from the
institutional extracorporeal membrane oxygenation registry.
INTERVENTIONS: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical characteristics and outcomes were
investigated for patients with primary cardiac arrhythmia supported with
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Outcomes investigated were time from
initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support to arrhythmia control, 
duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and results of
interventions performed while supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
We summarized the independent categorical and continuous variables using
frequencies, percentages, and medians and ranges, respectively. Extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation support was used in nine patients for rescue therapy for
primary tachyarrhythmia and bradycardia. The primary arrhythmias were: focal
atrial tachycardia (n = 2); reentrant supraventricular tachycardia (n = 3);
junctional ectopic tachycardia (n = 2); and congenital complete atrioventricular 
block (n = 2) patients. Seven patients presented with severe hemodynamic
compromise, with six patients requiring extracorporeal cardiopulmonary
resuscitation. All patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within
24 hrs of initial presentation. Balloon atrial septostomy was performed in three 
patients and ablation was performed in two patients. Sinus rhythm was achieved in
all reentrant supraventricular tachycardia and rate control was established in
both patients with focal atrial tachycardia and in one patient with junctional
ectopic tachycardia while using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. All 
patients survived to hospital discharge, and median follow-up for the cohort was 
5 yrs. There was one late death; all survivors had good overall and neurologic
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The requirement of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in
newborns and infants with intractable arrhythmia is rare. Extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation support does potentially carry morbidity; however, to prevent
arrhythmia-related mortality, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and/or 
extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be considered in the
management of hemodynamically unstable primary arrhythmias as an emergent
lifesaving procedure.

INTRODUCTION: Congenital heart block (CHB) is a passively acquired autoimmune
disease considered to be due to the transfer of maternal autoantibodies,
anti-SSA/Ro -SSB/La, to the fetus resulting in atrioventricular (AV) block and
sinus bradycardia. We previously established a murine model for CHB where pups
born to immunized wild-type (WT) mothers exhibited electrocardiographic
abnormalities similar to those seen in CHB and demonstrated inhibition of L-type 
Ca channels (LTCCs) by maternal antibodies. Here, we hypothesize that
overexpression of LTCC should rescue, whereas knockout of LTCC should worsen the 
electrocardiographic abnormalities in mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Transgenic (TG) mice were immunized with SSA/Ro and SSB/La
antigens. Pups born to immunized WT mothers had significantly greater sinus
bradycardia and AV block compared to pups from nonimmunized WT. TG pups
overexpressing LTCC had significantly less sinus bradycardia and AV block
compared to their non-TG littermates and to pups born to immunized WT mothers.
All LTCC knockout pups born to immunized mothers had sinus bradycardia, advanced 
degree of AV block, and decreased fetal parity. No sinus bradycardia or AV block 
were manifested in pups from control nonimmunized WT mothers. IgG from mothers
with CHB children, but not normal IgG, completely inhibited intracellular Ca
transient ([Ca](i)T) amplitude.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac-specific overexpression of LTCC significantly reduced the
incidence of AV block and sinus bradycardia in pups exposed to anti-SSA/Ro
-SSB/La autoantibodies, whereas exposure of LTCC knockout pups to these
autoantibodies significantly worsened the electrocardiographic abnormalities.
These findings support the hypothesis that maternal antibodies inhibit LTCC and
[Ca](i)T thus contributing to the development of CHB. Altogether, the results are
relevant to the development of novel therapies for CHB.

Isolated complete congenital heart block (CHB) in the majority of cases is
associated with the presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens 
in the maternal serum. The prognosis is less favorable in fetuses with a
ventricular rate < 55bpm. We have reported a case of a fetus with an isolated
non-autoimmune CHB with an extremely low ventricular rate (34bpm) in which the
outcome was favorable. In the neonate the non-compaction of the myocardium was
diagnosed.

OBJECTIVE: To study anti-Ro/La-negative congenital heart block (CHB).
METHODS: Forty-five fetuses with CHB were evaluated by analysis of anti-Ro/La
antibodies using sensitive laboratory methods.
RESULTS: There were 9 cases of anti-Ro/La-negative CHB; 3 died (33.3%). Only 3
(33.3%) were complete in utero and 5 (55.5%) were unstable. No specific etiology 
was diagnosed. Six infants (66.6%) were given pacemakers. There were 36 cases of 
anti-Ro/La-positive CHB. All except 2 infants (94.4%) had complete
atrioventricular block in utero. Ten died (27.8%), one (2.7%) developed severe
dilated cardiomyopathy, and 26 (72.2%) were given pacemakers.
CONCLUSION: Nine of the 45 consecutive CHB cases (20%) were anti-Ro/La-negative
with no known cause. They were less stable and complete than the anti-Ro/La
positive cases.

Extremely low ventricular rate in a fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune
complete congenital heart block. Case report.

Padua, Padua, Italy.

Congenital complete heart block (CCHB) is an uncommon disorder with an incidence 
of about 1/20,000 in liveborn infants. It can occur in the setting of
structurally normal heart or with structural disease; it is associated with high 
mortality and morbidity and requires a high index of suspicion for early
diagnosis and therapy. Isolated CCHB in a fetus is usually associated with the
presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens in the maternal
circulation. Such antibodies cross into the fetal circulation and cause
inflammation of the conduction tissues; the causal mechanism is not known.
Although the prognosis for the majority of fetuses is good, it is less favourable
in fetuses with a ventricular rate <55 bpm in early pregnancy or with a decrease 
in the ventricular rate by >5 bpm during pregnancy. It is not known if the same
prognostic criteria apply for fetuses with isolated non-autoimmune CCHB. This
article reports authors' experience in managing a pregnancy with an extremely low
fetal heart rate (47 bpm) in a single fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune CCHB 
in which the outcome was favorable.

BACKGROUND: Advances in pacing technology have increased indications for
antibradycardia pacing and new indications have appeared for treatment of atrial 
tachycardia and cardiac failure in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Implantation of a pacemaker is mandatory for symptomatic
children with complete atrio-ventricular block (CAVB). In asymptomatic neonates
and infants, prophylactic pacing is indicated when the ventricular rhythm is <55 
beats per minute (bpm) or 70 bpm in case of significant cardiac malformations.
Beyond one year of age, PM implantation is recommended in children with an
average heart rate <50 bpm or long pauses on 24-hour recordings. Post-operative
block that persists 7 days after cardiac surgery is a class I indication for
pacing. Postoperative heart block may also be transient, but patients with
residual conduction abnormalities and a long HV interval have a high risk of late
sudden death and should be paced. After cardiac surgery, atrial pacing may also
be considered, in patients with severe sinus bradycardia and symptoms, or in
those requiring antiarrhythmic drugs for tachy-bradycardia syndrome; in case of
failure of antiarrhythmic drugs, antitachycardia atrial pacing now appears to be 
safe and efficacious. Finally, cardiac resynchronization therapy may apply to
children with congenital heart block and cardiomyopathy, as well as to the
population with CHD. Methods and results are described in the section dedicated
to resynchronization.
CONCLUSION: Cardiac pacing indications have extended beyond prevention of sudden 
death and pacemaker implantation is now indicated to improve quality of life of
patients with CHD and as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a rare immune disease. Clinical findings
include congenital heart block (CHB), cutaneous manifestations, and hepatic and
haematological abnormalities. The authors present a case of a baby with prenatal 
diagnosis of bradycardia. On the first day of life, she was bradycardic and a CHB
(Mobitz type II) with left branch complete block was diagnosed. She had no
structural cardiac abnormalities on the scan. Spontaneous resolution of the CHB
occurred and she was discharged on the seventh day of life. On the third month of
life cutaneous lesions and alimental difficulties were noted. She was diagnosed a
complete heart block and a definitive pacemaker was instituted with clinical
improvement. Anti-Ro antibodies were positive in the mother and in the child,
with the skin biopsy consistent with NLE. Heart block is usually permanent but it
can spontaneously revert temporarily to sinus rhythm. A long term follow-up is
essential.

This report presents the case of an infant who was born with transient complete
heart block. The cardiac rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm within 12 hours 
of life. Following the diagnosis in this infant of congenital heart block, both
the mother and the infant were tested for autoantibodies. Both were found to be
strongly positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. The infant was also weakly positive
for the anti-La/SSB antibodies and her mother moderately positive for the same.
Congenital heart block associated with these maternal antibodies is well
documented in the literature; however, this is the only reported case that
documents a transient nature of the complete heart block.

We present a case of unpaced pre-existing congenital heart block in pregnancy,
diagnosed for the first time in labour. Our patient was asymptomatic and was
managed conservatively with temporary pacing equipment on standby. She had a
post-partum cardiology follow-up and was paced in the puerperium. We discuss the 
aetiopathogenesis and the variable presentation patterns of bradyarrhythmia in
pregnancy and the multidisciplinary approach to their management. Our
recommendations combine the Advanced Life Support algorithm for treatment of
bradycardia and the successful management strategies of several documented case
reports in the literature.

Cellular rejection of the conduction system after orthotopic heart

We report a case of severe acute cellular rejection of the cardiac allograft
conduction system in a 15-month-old girl who received orthotopic heart
transplantation (OHT) for congestive heart failure from a congenital heart block.
Post-operatively, the patient was treated for clinical evidence of rejection, but
did not have electrocardiographic findings of heart block. Six weeks after
transplantation, the patient developed sudden-onset bradycardia and died. Autopsy
showed severe acute cellular rejection involving primarily the conduction system.
Cellular rejection of the cardiac conduction system is a potentially lethal
complication of OHT. Although diagnostic modalities to predict or detect ongoing 
cellular rejection in the conduction system are limited, recognizing the early
signs, such as post-operative heart block, may prevent devastating consequences.

Waldenström's hypergammaglobulinemic purpura (HGP) is a rare chronic disorder
characterized by recurrent purpura on the legs, a polyclonal increase in serum
gamma-globulin, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a positive
rheumatoid factor. A 30-year-old primigravid woman with 14 years of HGP was found
to have fetal bradycardia at 25 weeks' gestation. Laboratory investigations
demonstrated positive anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in the maternal
serum. Cesarean delivery was performed at 39 weeks, and a 2750-g female infant
was born with complete atrioventricular block. Fortunately, the neonatal period
has been uneventful without need for pace-making. Maternal HGP exacerbated just
after delivery, but resolved within 1 week without treatment. Physicians should
be aware of the possible presence of neonatal lupus-related anti-Ro/SSA and
anti-La/SSB autoantibodies in patients with HGP. Screening for these
autoantibodies is important and could be used as a marker to identify and manage 
high-risk pregnancies.

5-hydroxytryptamine receptors in the human cardiovascular system.

Kaumann AJ(1), Levy FO.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Physiology, University of Cambridge, UK.

The human cardiovascular system is exposed to plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT,
serotonin), usually released from platelets. 5-HT can produce harmful acute and
chronic effects. The acute cardiac effects of 5-HT consist of tachycardia
(preceded on occasion by a brief reflex bradycardia), increased atrial
contractility and production of atrial arrhythmias. Acute inotropic, lusitropic
and arrhythmic effects of 5-HT on human ventricle become conspicuous after
inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity. Human cardiostimulation is
mediated through 5-HT4 receptors. Atrial and ventricular PDE3 activity exerts a
protective role against potentially harmful cardiostimulation. Chronic exposure
to high levels of 5-HT (from metastatic carcinoid tumours), the anorectic drug
fenfluramine and its metabolites, as well as the ecstasy drug
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its metabolite
3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) are associated with proliferative disease and
thickening of cardiac valves, mediated through 5-HT2B receptors. 5-HT2B receptors
have an obligatory physiological role in murine cardiac embryology but whether
this happens in humans requires research. Congenital heart block (CHB) is, on
occasion, associated with autoantibodies against 5-HT4 receptors. Acute vascular 
constriction by 5-HT is usually shared by 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors, except in 
intracranial arteries which constrict only through 5-HT1B receptors. Both 5-HT1B 
and 5-HT2A receptors can mediate coronary artery spasm but only 5-HT1B receptors 
appear involved in coronary spasm of patients treated with triptans or with
Prinzmetal angina. 5-HT2A receptors constrict the portal venous system including 
oesophageal collaterals in cirrhosis. Chronic exposure to 5-HT can contribute to 
pulmonary hypertension through activation of constrictor 5-HT1B receptors and
proliferative 5-HT2B receptors, and possibly through direct intracellular
effects.

Congenital complete heart block can be isolated or can occur in association with 
other structural heart diseases. Isolated congenital complete heart block (CCHB) 
is due to transplacental transfer of autoantibodies from mothers with connective 
tissue disease. Congenital heart block is usually complete, but incomplete
blocks, sinus bradycardia and QTc prolongation are also reported. Anti SS A and
Anti SS B antibodies transferred from mothers have inflammatory and
arrhythmogenic effects in the fetal conduction system. Cardiac manifestations
reported include dilated cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis and mitral
insufficiency. Low ventricular rate, QT prolongation and arrhythmias on
monitoring are high risk features. CCHB has a mortality of 30%, and 60% of
infants require pacemaker therapy. Fetal echocardiography is useful in early
diagnosis. Prophylactic steroid therapy is controversial. Beta adrenergic
agonists were tried in mothers with fetuses having congenital heart block to
increase fetal heart rate. Early pacemaker therapy is indicated in patients with 
symptomatic bradycardia and ventricular dysfunction. The indications for pacing
in congenital heart block continue to evolve with advances in techniques and most
of these children will ultimately require permanent pacemakers by adulthood.

A surprising case of sustained antenatal fetal bradycardia.

Salazar SS.

Persistent fetal bradycardia noted in the antenatal period can occur secondary to
maternal conditions, fetal cardiac structural defects, or from congenital heart
block. Fetal bradycardia can be mistaken for maternal pulse and should be
confirmed with ultrasound whenever possible. Prompt evaluation of the fetus with 
bradycardia can lead to early interventions designed to prevent cardiac damage
and/or hydrops.

Cardiovascular involvement is common in connective tissue diseases (CTD), with
relevant implications in terms of morbidity and mortality. Rhythm disturbances,
i.e. conduction defects and tachyarrhythmias, represent a frequent clinical
manifestation of CTD-associated cardiovascular damage and a possible cause of
sudden death. The underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms are probably multiple and 
intriguing, even though the myocardial fibrosis frequently observed at the
pathological examination seems to play a pivotal role. Myocardial fibrosis is
produced directly by inflammatory processes, or indirectly as a consequence of
coronary artery occlusive disease, and it may affect the conduction system also
representing the pathological substrate for reentry circles. An overview of
CTD-associated cardiac rhythm disturbances is here provided. Among CTD-associated
rhythm disorders, congenital heart block (CHB), which represents the main feature
of neonatal lupus, a rare syndrome related to the transplacental passage of
autoantibodies from anti-Ro/SSA-positive mother to their newborns, seems to
acknowledge a peculiar mechanism of disease possibly dependent on a direct
arrhythmogenicity of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. Moreover, new anti-Ro/SSA-associated
EKG abnormalities have been recently described in children (sinus bradycardia and
corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation) as well as in adults (QTc interval
prolongation).

Children born from mothers positive for autoantibodies against SSA/Ro and/or
anti-SSB/La ribonucleoproteins may develop heart conduction tissue damage
resulting in atrioventricular block and/or transient skin rash, liver enzyme
abnormalities and anaemia/thrombocytopenia. Additional transient
electrocardiographic abnormalities (sinus bradycardia, QT interval prolongation) 
have been reported. Such clinical and laboratory manifestations are included in
the so-called neonatal lupus syndromes, independently whether the mother is
suffering from a systemic autoimmune disease or is totally asymptomatic. The
prevalence of the congenital heart block is around 2%, of neonatal rash around
20%, while laboratory abnormalities in asymptomatic babies can be detected in up 
to 40% of cases. The risk of recurrence of complete heart block is almost 10
times higher in the following pregnancies. Most of the mothers are asymptomatic
at delivery and are identified only by the birth of an affected child. Their
long-term outcome is generally more reassuring than previously assumed. Serial
echocardiograms and obstetric sonograms, performed at least every 2 weeks,
starting from 16 weeks gestation, are recommended in anti-Ro/SSA positive
pregnant women: the goal is to detect early fetal abnormalities, that might
precede complete atrioventricular block and that might be a target for preventive
therapy. Transplacental passage of maternal anti-SSA/Ro -SSB/La IgG is thought to
be pivotal in inducing tissue damage. However, the discordant appearance of the
syndrome in twins does suggest a role also for fetal or environmental factors.

OBJECTIVE: To study the incidence and the features of congenital heart block
(CHB) in patients with undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) and
primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).
METHODS: We studied 81 pregnancies of 41 women attending the Outpatients' Clinic 
of the Rheumatology Unit of University Hospital of Padova from July 1989 to March
2004. Twenty five of these (61%) were affected with UCTD and 16 (39%) with pSS.
Serologic inclusion criteria was anti-Ro/La positivity, assessed by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis and ELISA.
RESULTS: CHB was found in 2 out of the 46 (4.3%) pregnancies followed by our
Staff and in 2 out of the 35 (5.7%) included in the retrospective part of the
study. In 3 cases CHB was a 3rd degree block, causing pregnancy termination in 2.
The only 2nd degree block was identified in one patient at the 22nd week of
gestation and treated with dexamethasone and plasma-exchange. All of the women
were positive to 52 kd and 60 kd Ro autoantibodies. CHB mothers had higher titer 
antibodies to 52 kd Ro protein than did the mothers with healthy infants (P =
0.026). Electrocardiographic abnormalities at birth were found in 3 out of 29
asymptomatic infants. One presented sinus bradycardia, the second abnormalities
of ventricular repolarization, both regressed spontaneously, while the third
ventricular extrasystoles which continue even now at 5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: These results showed that in UCTD and pSS there is a higher
incidence of CHB than that reported in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.
Electrocardiographic screening in all infants born to mothers with anti-Ro/La
antibodies would seem an important measure to identify those with irreversible
heart conduction abnormalities.

Novel molecular mechanism involving alpha1D (Cav1.3) L-type calcium channel in
autoimmune-associated sinus bradycardia.

Qu Y(1), Baroudi G, Yue Y, Boutjdir M.

Author information: 
(1)VA New York Harbor Healthcare System, New York, NY, USA.

BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block (CHB) is an autoimmune disease that affects
fetuses/infants born to mothers with anti-Ro/La antibodies (positive IgG).
Although the hallmark of CHB is complete atrioventricular block, sinus
bradycardia has been reported recently in animal models of CHB. Interestingly,
knockout of the neuroendocrine alpha1D Ca channel in mice results in significant 
sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, a phenotype reminiscent to that
seen in CHB. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the alpha1D Ca channel is a
novel target for positive IgG.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, confocal
indirect immunostaining, and Western blot data established the expression of the 
alpha1D Ca channel in the human fetal heart. The effect of positive IgG on
alpha1D Ca current (I(Ca-L)) was characterized in heterologous expression systems
(tsA201 cells and Xenopus oocytes) because of the unavailability of
alpha1D-specific modulators. alpha1D I(Ca-L) activated at negative potentials
(between -60 and -50 mV). Positive IgG inhibited alpha1D I(Ca-L) in both
expression systems. This inhibition was rescued by a Ca channel activator, Bay
K8644. No effect on alpha1D I(Ca-L) was observed with negative IgG and denatured 
positive IgG. Western blot data showed that positive IgG binds directly to
alpha1D Ca channel protein.
CONCLUSIONS: The data are the first to demonstrate (1) expression of the alpha1D 
Ca channel in human fetal heart, (2) inhibition of alpha1D I(Ca-L) by positive
IgG, and (3) direct cross-reactivity of positive IgG with the alpha1D Ca channel 
protein. Given that alpha1D I(Ca-L) activates at voltages within the pacemaker's 
diastolic depolarization, inhibition of alpha1D I(Ca-L) in part may account for
autoimmune-associated sinus bradycardia. In addition, Bay K8644 rescue of alpha1D
I(Ca-L) inhibition opens new directions in the development of pharmacotherapeutic
approaches in the management of CHB.

Apart from complete and incomplete congenital heart block (CHB), new cardiac
manifestations related to anti-SSA/Ro antibodies have been reported in children
born to mothers bearing these antibodies. These manifestations include transient 
fetal first-degree heart block, prolongation of corrected QT (QTc) interval,
sinus bradycardia, late-onset cardiomyopathy, endocardial fibroelastosis and
cardiac malformations. Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are not considered pathogenic to
the adult heart, but a prolongation of the QTc interval has recently been
reported in adult patients and is still a matter of debate. Treatment of CHB is
not well established and needs to be assessed carefully. The risks and benefits
of prenatal fluorinated steroids are discussed.

Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The pathogenesis of congenital heart block (CHB) remains unclear. The occurrence 
rate of neonatal CHB is low, even in murine models of lupus erythematosus. The
assessment of heart block in murine maternal lupus models by measuring
atrioventricular conduction in neonatal offspring is potentially confounded by
fetal wastage. We therefore sought to develop a murine CHB model with a superior 
immune response and to use embryonic Doppler echocardiography to observe
conduction system damage in the fetus. Mature 8-wk-old female C3H/HeJ mice (n=43)
were immunized with 60 kD Ro, 48 kD La, or recombinant calreticulin autoantigens.
ELISA confirmed that significant serum autoantibodies developed in all three
immunized groups when compared with controls. Starting at 13 d of gestation, a
significantly lower fetal heart rate (HR) and a higher percentage of fetal
bradycardia/atrioventricular block (AVB, nonadvanced second degree) were observed
in all immunized groups, compared with controls. There was 9-18% nonadvanced
second-degree AVB in immunized groups and 0% in controls at <18 d of gestation.
Neonatal electrocardiograms demonstrated only 1 degrees AVB in immunized groups. 
Maternal immunization with 60 kD Ro, 48 kD La, or recombinant calreticulin
autoantigens resulted in AVB in a significant percentage of fetuses, however,
lesser degrees of AVB were seen at birth. Significant fetal bradycardia and AVB
may be missed by assessment only at birth in murine models of CHB due to fetal
wastage.

OBJECTIVE: Aside from congenital heart block (CHB), sinus bradycardia and
prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval have been reported in infants
born to mothers with anti-SSA antibodies. To assess the pathologic nature of
these manifestations, this study focused on electrocardiographic (EKG) variations
in these children, comparing them with findings in a control group.
METHODS: We studied 165 consecutive pregnancies in 106 anti-SSA-positive women
with connective tissue diseases (CTDs). EKGs obtained on 58 children of this
group were compared with those obtained on 85 infants born to mothers with CTD
who were negative for both anti-SSA and anti-SSB.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was seen between the 2 study
groups with regard to gestational age, prematurity, birth weight, age of the
children at the time of EKG, age of the mothers, or treatments received by the
mothers during their pregnancies. Seven of 137 children developed cutaneous
neonatal lupus syndrome; 1 child developed CHB (CHB risk of 1 in 99 [1%] if only 
the first prospectively observed pregnancy in women without a history of CHB is
included in the analysis). For EKGs recorded during the first 2 months of life,
the mean +/- SD PR interval was 96 +/- 16 msec in the anti-SSA-positive group and
96 +/- 13 msec in the anti-SSA-negative group (P = 0.84), with mean QTc values of
397 +/- 27 and 395 +/- 25 msec (P = 0.57) and mean heart rates of 141 +/- 23 and 
137 +/- 21 beats per minute (P = 0.20), respectively. No difference in the PR
interval, QTc interval, or heart rate was observed for EKGs obtained between 2
and 4 months of life. When EKGs obtained at 0-2 months were compared with those
obtained at 2-4 months, a physiologic prolongation of the QTc interval was
observed in both study groups. No sudden infant death or symptomatic arrhythmia
occurred during the first year of life.
CONCLUSION: The EKG findings in children of anti-SSA-positive and
anti-SSA-negative mothers were not significantly different. Our results suggest
that the prolongation of the QTc interval and sinus bradycardia that have
recently been reported in children of mothers with anti-SSA antibodies occur
independently of the anti-SSA antibodies. The pathologic nature of these EKG
variations was not confirmed by our controlled study.

Congenital heart block (CHB) associated with maternal anti-SSA/SSB antibodies: a 
report of four cases. CHB detected in utero is strongly associated with maternal 
antibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La). Their pathogenic role in the development of 
CHB has been established in several studies. The mothers of affected infants
frequently had autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's
syndrome) or were entirely asymptomatic. It is very difficult to identify
pregnant asymptomatic mothers carrying anti-SSA/SSB antibodies. We report four
cases of infants born to asymptomatic mothers with anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, three
of them developed isolated congenital cardiac heart block and one with no
evidence of CHB. All three CHB are detected during pregnancy between 16 and 24
weeks of gestation. All maternal sera contained antibodies to SSA alone or the
both SSA and SSB. Three of four subsequent pregnancies were complicated by heart 
block. One child affected died in utero. While the two other newborns with CHB
required pacemaker insertion during the first 3 months of life. Although the
association of anti-SSA/SSB with CHB is widely accepted, the precise mechanism by
which these antibodies cause cardiac conduction abnormalities remains to be
defined. Antibodies to SSA/SSB have been proposed to be a serologic marker for
neonatal lupus syndrome and CHB. Fetal and neonatal diseases are presumed to be
due to the transplacental passage of these IgG autoantibodies from the mother
into the fetal circulation. Since these antibodies may have a pathogenic role in 
CHB, screening of infants with isolated CHB or neonatal lupus and their mothers
for the presence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB is strongly recommended.

Functional basis of sinus bradycardia in congenital heart block.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is a conduction abnormality characterized by
complete atrioventricular (AV) block. CHB affects fetuses and/or newborn of
mothers with autoantibodies reactive with ribonucleoproteins 48-kDa SSB/La,
52-kDa SSA/Ro, and 60-kDa SSA/Ro. We recently established animal models of CHB
and reported, for the first time, significant sinus bradycardia preceding AV
block. This unexpected observation implies that the spectrum of conduction
abnormalities extends beyond the AV node to also affect the SA node. To test this
hypothesis, we investigated the functional basis of this sinus bradycardia by
characterizing the effects of antibodies from mothers with CHB children (positive
IgG) on ionic currents that are known to significantly contribute to spontaneous 
pacing in SA node cells. We recorded L- (I(Ca.L)) and T- (I(Ca.T)) type Ca2+,
delayed rectifier K+ (I(K)), hyperpolarization-activated (I(f)) currents, and
action potentials (APs) from young rabbit SA node cells. We demonstrated that
positive IgG significantly inhibited both I(Ca.T) and I(Ca.L) and induced sinus
bradycardia but did not affect I(f) and I(K). Normal IgG from mothers with
healthy children did not affect all the currents studied and APs. These results
establish that IgG from mothers with CHB children causes substantial inhibition
of I(Ca.T) and I(Ca.L), two important pacemaker currents in rabbit SA node cells 
and point to both I(Ca.T) and I(Ca.L) as major players in the ionic mechanism by 
which maternal antibodies induce sinus bradycardia in CHB. These novel findings
have important clinical significance and suggest that sinus bradycardia may be a 
potential marker in the detection and prevention of CHB. The full text of this

Successful outcome in a fetus with an extremely low heart rate due to isolated
complete congenital heart block.

Isolated complete congenital heart block (CCHB) in a fetus is usually associated 
with the presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens in the
maternal circulation. Although the prognosis for the majority of fetuses is good,
it is less favorable in fetuses with a ventricular rate < 55 bpm in early
pregnancy or with a decrease in the ventricular rate by >/= 5 bpm during
pregnancy. It is not known if the same prognostic criteria apply for the
occasional fetus with isolated non-autoimmune CCHB. We report a case of a single 
fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune CCHB with an extremely low ventricular rate
(37 bpm) in which the outcome was favorable. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare
complication in patients with isolated CCHB, despite early institution of cardiac
pacing, and is usually recognized after several months of relative well-being. It
is assumed that in the majority of patients it represents a sequel to in utero
autoimmune or postnatal reactivation myocarditis. However, the possibility of a
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy caused by an excessively high pacing rate
should also be taken into consideration, as was clearly demonstrated in our
patient.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancies complicated by congenital heart block usually have a poor
prognosis when there is severe fetal bradycardia.
CASE: We present a pregnancy with fetal heart rate of 40 beats per minute. She
previously delivered a child with third-degree heart block by cesarean at 28
weeks. This pregnancy was complicated by a high ribonucleoprotein antibody
anti-Ro/SSA titer and fetal bradycardia. The patient was treated with steroids
and beta-mimetics. The fetus continued to grow normally with reassuring
biophysical profiles. After fetal lung maturity documentation at 34 weeks, she
delivered by repeat cesarean a healthy 2349-g infant who required a permanent
pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: Reassuring antepartum testing and normal growth in pregnant women
with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and congenital heart block may allow expectant
management until fetal maturity.

Congenital heart block (CHB), defined as an atrioventricular block diagnosed in
utero, at birth, or within the neonatal period (0-27 d after birth), is a rare
disorder closely linked to transplacental transport of maternal antibodies
anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB. These antibodies may induce a myocarditis, or
interact directly with calcium channel proteins with disturbance of transmembrane
signaling at the level of the conduction tissue, or interfere with apoptosis.
Depending on the severity of the process, the fetus may die in utero or a few
days after birth or survive to the perinatal period and have a near-normal life; 
in most survivors a pace-maker must be implanted. Skin lesions, haematological
disorders, and hepatic cholestasis are other transient clinical features of the
syndrome. Sinus bradycardia and QT interval prolongation may be observed as well 
in babies born from anti-Ro/SSA positive mothers. The risk of recurrence of
complete block ranges from 10-17%. Most of the mothers are asymptomatic at
delivery and are identified only by the birth of an affected child. Their
long-term outcome generally is more reassuring than previously assumed and
arthralgias and dry eyes are the most common symptoms. A standard therapy for
blocks detected in utero still does not exist. The prevalence of complete CHB in 
newborns of anti-Ro/SSA positive women and with known connective-tissue disease
was 2%. Serial echocardiograms and obstetric sonograms, performed at least every 
2 wk starting from the 16 wk gestation, are recommended in anti-Ro/SSA positive
pregnant women.

Congenital heart block in neonatal lupus: the pediatric cardiologist's
perspective.

Friedman DM(1), Rupel A, Glickstein J, Buyon JP.

Author information:

York 10025, USA. dfriedman@slrhc.org

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Congenital heart block (CHB) in the absence of major
structural abnormalities is associated with maternal antibodies to Ro (SS-A) and 
La (SS-B). CHB is most commonly diagnosed between 18 and 24 wk of gestation, and 
may be first, second or third degree (complete). Mortality approaches
approximately 20%, and most surviving children require pacemakers. Affected
infants may develop cardiomyopathy. Abnormalities in the skin, liver and blood of
neonates are also associated with anti-Ro/La antibodies, and are usually
self-limiting; these manifestations and CHB are collectively referred to as
neonatal lupus syndromes (NLS).
INVESTIGATION OF PATHOGENESIS: Recent studies demonstrate that Ro/La
ribonucleoproteins appear on the surface of apoptotic fetal cardiocytes and are
recognized by their cognate antibodies, promoting an inflammatory response. Mice 
immunized with Ro/La proteins have offspring with conduction abnormalities. In
vitro, human serum and IgG with anti-Ro/La antibodies affect the conducting
properties of isolated animal heart tissue.
DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS: If fetal bradycardia is identified, a 2-dimensional and
M-mode fetal echocardiographic and Doppler ultrasound should be obtained to
determine whether there is an atrial arrhythmia or atrioventricular (AV) block,
and to what degree, and whether there are major structural abnormalities of the
heart. The mother's serum should be tested by ELISA for anti-Ro and/or anti-La
antibodies.
THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS: To date, only anecdotal and retrospective evidence guides in
utero therapy of CHB. A prospective trial is currently underway to evaluate the
efficacy of maternal oral dexamethasone in treating newly identified first,
second or third degree block. Established third-degree block appears to be
irreversible. Dexamethasone and sympathomimetics may be of some benefit in
treating hydrops fetalis. In pregnant women with anti-Ro/La antibodies,
prophylactic therapy is not indicated but serial echocardiographic analysis is
strongly recommended, with emphasis on the mechanical PR interval to identify a
reversible block.
CONCLUSION: CHB occurs in approximately 1-5% of pregnancies in mothers with
anti-Ro/La antibodies, independent of the mother's disease status, and in
approximately 15-20% of pregnancies following the birth of a child with NLS.
Treatment of CHB identified in utero is not established but guidelines are
provided. Serial echocardiographic monitoring of high-risk pregnancies, using the
mechanical PR interval to identify first degree block, may afford the earliest
opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of Congenital Heart Block (CHB) in newborns
from anti Ro/SS-A antibodies positive mothers affected by connective tissue
diseases (CTD) and to evaluate the prevalence of other manifestations of Neonatal
Lupus (NL) and the electrocardiographic abnormalities. METHODS: A prospective
study was conducted on 100 anti Ro/SS-A positive mothers that were followed
before and during their 118 pregnancies (4 twin pregnancies and 18 second
pregnancies). Counterimmunoelectroforesis (CIE) and immunoblot (IB) were used to 
test antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA). RESULTS: Only 2 cases of
CHB (1.8%) were found among the 112 living newborns. In one case the mother with 
primary Sjögren's Syndrome (pSS) was anti Ro 60 and 52kD positive while in the
other case the mother affected by undifferentiated connective tissue disease
(UCTD) was anti Ro 60kD and anti La positive. No fetal death was due to CHB.
There were no cutaneous rashes at birth while mild hepatic enzyme alterations
were observed in 21 (68%) of the 31 tested newborns. In 22 healthy newborns an
ECG have been registered and in 4 cases (18.2%) sinus bradycardia was found.
During the follow up 7 suckling showed Cutaneous Neonatal Lupus. Moreover a six
month girl developed Kawasaki Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of delivering a
child with CHB is 1.8% in anti Ro/SS-A positive mothers with CTD. This finding is
extremely important in the preconceptional counseling of anti-Ro/SS-A positive
women. Furthermore mild electrocardiographic abnormalities may be found in their 
healthy newborns.

The classic cardiac manifestation of neonatal lupus is congenital heart block,
attributed to antibody-mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrosis of the
atrioventricular (AV) node. In considering the pathologic process of injury it
may be that tissue damage results in a range of conduction abnormalities.
Identification of less-advanced degrees of block or of fibrosis around the AV
node without any conduction abnormality on EKG would support this pathologic
model, and serve as a potential marker for treatment if the conduction defect
could be shown to progress. To ascertain the spectrum of arrhythmias associated
with maternal anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibodies, records of all children enrolled in 
the Research Registry for Neonatal Lupus were reviewed. Of 187 children with
congenital heart block whose mothers have anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibodies, nine had
a prolonged PR interval on EKG at birth, four of whom progressed to more advanced
AV block. A child whose younger sibling had third degree block was diagnosed with
first degree block at age 10 years at the time of surgery for a broken wrist. Two
children diagnosed in utero with second degree block were treated with
dexamethasone and reverted to normal sinus rhythm by birth, but ultimately
progressed to third degree block. Four children had second degree block at birth:
of these, two progressed to third degree block. Sinus bradycardia (< 100 bpm) was
present in three (3.8%) of 78 fetuses for whom atrial rates were recorded by
echocardiogram. Of 40 neonates for whom EKGs were available, the mean atrial rate
was 137+/-20 bpm (range 75-200). These data have important research and clinical 
implications. In contrast to the AV node, permanent sinoatrial nodal involvement 
is not clinically apparent. Perhaps many fetuses sustain mild inflammation, but
resolution is variable, as suggested by the presence of incomplete AV block.
Since subsequent progression of less-advanced degrees of block can occur, an EKG 
should be performed on all infants born to mothers with anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La
antibodies.

The etiologies of complete heart block in thirty-one children (mean age 5.5 +/-
5.2 years, range 0-14 years) diagnosed at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital
between 1990-2001 were reviewed. Three main groups of patients were identified:
1) patients who presented in utero or in the newborn period (congenital heart
block, n = 6), 2) patients who had complete heart block after cardiac surgery
(postoperative heart block, n = 10), and 3) children outside the newborn period
with a new diagnosis of complete heart block unrelated to cardiac surgery
(unknown etiology, n = 15). Among 15 patients in the last group, 5 were
asymptomatic (or minimally symptomatic) with complete heart block unexpectedly
found. These patients probably had previously undetected congenital heart block. 
Two patients had complete heart block associated with mild viral illness, but no 
bradycardia-related symptom. The etiology for heart block in these 2 patients was
unknown. Eight patients probably had recent onset heart block because of new
bradycardia-related symptoms, or a previously documented normal heart rate. All
patients in this group were female (mean age 4.3 +/- 4.3 years, median 3.5
years). All were diagnosed between August and January, and the majority (75%) had
a history of non-specific viral illness in the preceding 2 weeks. Seven patients 
(87.5%) were acutely symptomatic. Syncope and/or seizure were the most common
presenting symptoms. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was found in only one 
patient. The etiology of complete heart block in these patients probably was an
acute viral myocarditis that preferentially affected the conduction system. Two
of these eight patients had complete recovery of the atrioventricular conduction.
The rest had no improvement or had only partial recovery and subsequently
underwent permanent cardiac pacemaker insertion.

Congenital heart block (CHB), detected at or before birth in a structurally
normal heart, is strongly associated with autoantibodies reactive with the
intracellular soluble ribonucleoproteins 48kD SSB/La, 52kD SSA/Ro, and 60kD
SSA/Ro. CHB is presumed to be due to the transplacental passage of autoantibodies
from the mother into the fetal circulation. Varying degrees of heart block have
been reported. Although second degree block has, on rare occasion, reverted to
normal sinus rhythm, complete atrio-ventricular (AV) block is irreversible. CHB
carries substantial mortality and morbidity, with > 60% of affected children
requiring lifelong pacemakers. The recurrence rate exceeds, by at least twofold, 
that of the first birth and is likely to influence the decision to have more
children. Curiously, the mother's heart is almost never affected (with complete
heart block) despite exposure to identical circulating autoantibodies. As part of
our continuing effort to understand the complex factors contributing to the
pathogenesis of CHB, we have established an animal model of CHB by immunizing
female mice with recombinant proteins/antigens, reproduced the human complete AV 
block in an isolated Langendorff perfused fetal heart, and correlated these
findings with L-type Ca channel inhibition by maternal antibodies from mothers of
children with CHB. In addition, we established a passive animal model by directly
injecting maternal antibodies into pregnant mice and reported significant sinus
bradycardia, indicating that the spectrum of conduction abnormalities may extend 
beyond the AV node. All together, the data provided strong evidence supporting an
etiologic role of antibody/Ca channel involvement in the pathogenesis of CHB.
However, other yet unknown factors seem necessary to explain the full expression 
of CHB.

Down-regulation of L-type calcium channel in pups born to 52 kDa SSA/Ro immunized
rabbits.

Congenital heart block is considered a model of passively acquired autoimmune
disease in which the mother generates anti-SSA/Ro and/or anti-SSB/La antibodies
that cross the placenta and presumably injure the heart of developing fetus. CHB 
is accompanied by ECG abnormalities including AV block, sinus bradycardia, and
ventricular dysfunction. Our previous data indicate that these abnormalities are 
caused by maternal autoantibody-mediated disturbance of L-type Ca channels. To
investigate the consequence of chronic exposure of L-type Ca channels in newborn 
pups to maternal autoantibodies during pregnancy, we immunized female rabbits
with human 52 kDa-SSA/Ro (Ro52) recombinant protein. ECG revealed that pups from 
the immunized group had varying degrees of conduction defects. In addition,
I(CaL) density and protein were reduced in hearts of pups from the immunized
group. Sera and purified IgG from immunized rabbits inhibited I(Ba) recorded from
oocytes with expressed alpha(1C) and beta(2a) subunits of L-type Ca channel. Pups
born to Ro52 immunized mothers exhibited down-regulation of L-type calcium
channels in heart. The data provide new insight into the pathogenesis of
congenital heart block.

Direct inhibition of expressed cardiac l- and t-type calcium channels by igg from
mothers whose children have congenital heart block.

Xiao GQ(1), Hu K, Boutjdir M.

BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block (CHB) is a disease that affects the offspring 
of mothers with autoimmune diseases. We recently reported that maternal sera
containing antibodies against SSA/Ro and SSB/La ribonucleoproteins (positive IgG)
inhibited L-type Ca current in isolated cardiac myocytes and induced sinus
bradycardia in a murine model of CHB. The direct interaction of positive IgG with
L-type Ca channel proteins and the possible inhibition of T-type Ca current that 
could account for the sinus bradycardia remain unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The 2-electrode voltage-clamp technique was used to record
currents via L-type (I(Ba)-alpha(1C) or I(Ba)-alpha(1C)+beta(2a)+alpha(2)/delta) 
and T-type (I(Ba)-alpha(1H)) Ca channels, Na channels (I(Na)-hH1), and K channels
(I(Ks)-minK+KvLQT1) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Positive IgG (350 microgram/mL)
inhibited I(Ba)-alpha(1C) by 50.6+/-4.7% (P<0.01) and
I(Ba)-alpha(1C)+beta(2a)+alpha(2)/delta by 50.9+/-4.2% (P<0.01); I(Ba)-alpha(1H) 
was reduced by 18.9+/-1.0% (P<0.01). Immunoblot data show cross-reactivity of
positive IgG with alpha(1C) subunit. Pretreatment of oocytes with atropine (1
micromol/L) or acetylcholine (10 micromol/L) did not affect the inhibitory effect
of IgG on I(Ba)-alpha(1C) and I(Ba)-alpha(1C)+beta(2a)+alpha(2)/delta (P<0.05).
Positive IgG had no effect, however, on either I(Na)-hH1 or I(Ks)-minK+KvLQT1.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive IgG inhibited expressed L-type I:(Ba) and cross-reacted
with the alpha(1C) subunit in Xenopus oocytes, providing strong evidence that
maternal antibodies interact directly with the pore-forming alpha(1)-subunit of
Ca channels. In addition, we show for the first time that positive IgG also
inhibited T-type I(Ba) but not I(Na)-hH1 or I(Ks)-minK+KvLQT1. This could
provide, in part, the ionic basis of sinus bradycardia reported in animal models 
of CHB and clinically in humans.

block.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is associated with high mortality and affects
children of mothers with autoantibodies (IgG) to ribonucleoproteins SSB/La and
SSA/Ro. IgG from mothers of children with CHB (positive IgG) was used to assess
activation patterns in both the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) of
Langendorff-perfused young rabbit hearts. Optical action potentials (AP) were
obtained by using a 124-site photodiode array with
4-[-[2-(di-n-butylamino)-6-naphthyl]vinyl]pyridinium. Optical APs were recorded
to simultaneously image activation patterns from the RA and RV. Perfusion of
positive IgG (800--1,200 micro resulted in sinus bradycardia and varying degrees 
of heart block. Activation maps revealed marked conduction delay at the
sinoatrial junction but only minor changes in overall atrial and ventricular
activation patterns. No conduction disturbances were seen in the presence of IgG 
from mothers with healthy children. In conclusion, besides atrioventricular (AV) 
block, positive IgG induces sinus bradycardia. These results establish that the
sequelae of CHB are associated with impaired intrasinus and/or sinoatrial
conduction. The findings raise the possibility that sinus bradycardia in the
developing heart may indicate the potential for AV conduction disturbances.

Recherche Scientifique, Strasbourg, France.

We have previously suggested that the recognition of a cross-reactive epitope on 
the 5-HT4 receptor and the 52-kDa SSA/Ro protein by serotonin-antagonizing
autoantibodies could explain the electrophysiological symptoms of congenital
heart block in neonatal lupus. To confirm this hypothesis, we immunized female
mice with four synthetic peptides corresponding to the recognized epitopes. All
mice developed anti-peptide antibodies, which cross-reacted with the Ro52 and
5-HT4 receptor peptides and recognized both cognate proteins. Peptide-immune mice
were mated. The pups from mice immunized with the Ro52 peptides had no symptoms
of neonatal lupus apart from bradycardia. However, pups from mice immunized with 
the 5-HT4 receptor peptides and bradycardia, atrioventricular block of type I or 
II, longer QT intervals, skin rashes and neuromotor problems. The 5-HT4 receptor 
was detectable in the different fetal tissues affected (heart, skin and brain) by
immunohistochemistry. Hearts from diseased pups were less developed and showed
disorganized myocardial hyperplasia, compared to the normal littermates. These
results demonstrate that the serotoninergic 5-HT4 receptor is the antigenic
target of physiopathological autoantibodies in neonatal lupus.

Comment in
    Circulation. 2000 Sep 12;102(11):E88-9.

BACKGROUND: It is a widely held view that congenital heart block (CHB) is caused 
by the transplacental transfer of maternal autoantibodies (anti-SSA/Ro and/or
anti-SSB/La) into the fetal circulation. To test this hypothesis and to reproduce
human CHB, an experimental mouse model (BALB/c) was developed by passive transfer
of human autoantibodies into pregnant mice.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Timed pregnant mice (n=54) were injected with a single
intravenous bolus of purified IgG containing human anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La
antibodies from mothers of children with CHB. To parallel the "window period" of 
susceptibility to CHB in humans, 3 groups of mice were used: 8, 11, and 16 days
of gestation. Within each group, we tested 10, 25, 50, and 100 microg of IgG. At 
delivery, ECGs were recorded and analyzed for conduction abnormalities.
Bradycardia and PR interval were significantly increased in 8-, 11-, and 16-day
gestational groups when compared with controls (P<0.05). QRS duration was not
significantly different between all groups. Antibody levels measured by ELISA in 
both mothers and their offspring confirmed the transplacental transfer of the
human antibodies to the pups.
CONCLUSIONS: The passive transfer model demonstrated bradycardia, first-degree
but not complete atrioventricular block in pups. The greater percentage and
degree of bradycardia and PR prolongation in the 11-day mouse group correlates
with the "window period" of susceptibility observed in humans. The high incidence
of bradycardia suggests possible sinoatrial node involvement. All together, these
data provide relevant insights into the pathogenesis of CHB.

1:1 atrioventricular conduction in congenital complete heart block.

McLeod KA(1), Rankin AC, Houston AB.

Author information:

A female neonate with congenital complete heart block developed atrioventricular 
conduction through an accessory pathway. Despite sinus rhythm and an adequate
heart rate she developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and died at age 14 months.
This case illustrates that underlying heart block can be present in individuals
with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and that the dilated
cardiomyopathy that occasionally accompanies autoimmune congenital heart block is
not primarily caused by bradycardia.

Although a strong clinical association exists between congenital heart block
(CHB) and an immune response to SSA/Ro and SSB/La proteins, a causative role of
these antibodies in the pathogenesis is just emerging. In a preliminary report,
we have demonstrated that IgG fractions isolated from the sera of mothers whose
children have CHB are arrhythmogenic in the human fetal heart. To more precisely 
define the arrhythmogenic effect of anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibodies, we used the
readily available rat heart model to record: 1) ECGs from Langendorff beating
hearts; 2) action potentials from atrioventricular (AV) nodal preparations; 3)
L-type Ca currents, I(Ca) at the whole-cell and single channel levels; and 4)
other currents such as the transient outward K+ current, I(to), the inward
rectifier K+ current, I(K1), and the Na+ current, I(Na). Perfusion of hearts with
purified IgG (800 microg/mL), isolated from the serum of a mother with SSA/Ro and
SSB/La antibodies whose child had CHB, resulted in bradycardia associated with
2:1 AV block. Simultaneous action potentials were recorded from dissected atrial 
and AV nodal areas of the rat heart. Superfusion of these preparations with the
same mother's IgG fraction resulted in 2:1 AV block followed by complete
inhibition of AV nodal action potential. Because AV nodal electrogenesis is
largely dependent on I(Ca), the effect of these antibodies on I(Ca) was
subsequently determined. Superfusion of myocytes with whole serum or purified IgG
(80 microg/mL) from the same mother consistently inhibited whole cell I(Ca),
ensemble average Ba2+ currents (I(Ba)) and open state probability, p(o), without 
affecting the channel conductance. IgG had no significant effect on I(to), I(K1),
or I(Na). Whole sera and IgG fractions from a healthy mother with no detectable
anti-SSA/Ro or SSB/La antibodies did not inhibit I(Ca) or I(Ba). These results
demonstrate that IgG containing anti-SSA/Ro and -SSB/La antibodies induces
complete AV block in beating hearts and in multicellular preparations, thus
implicating a preferential interaction of these autoantibodies with Ca channels
and/or associated regulatory proteins. This is consistent with the observed
inhibition of Ca channels that may be a critical factor contributing to the
pathogenesis of CHB.

Stokes-Adams attacks are fairly common in children with congenital complete heart

case of a 13-year-old boy with congenital heart block and an embolic stroke
involving the cerebral artery. Echocardiography revealed no valvular
regurgitation, hypokinetic segments, mural thrombus, or myxoma.
Electrocardiographic monitoring demonstrated good response of ventricular rate to
exercise and no episodes of atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia. It is assumed that

Neonatal lupus erythematosus related to maternal leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Borrego L(1), Rodríguez J, Soler E, Jiménez A, Hernández B.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Hospital Insular, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,
Canary Islands, Spain.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an autoimmune disease whose major findings 
are skin lesions and congenital heart block. Affected infants have maternal,
transplacentally acquired, autoantibodies to Ro/SSA, La/SSB, or U1-RNP antigens. 
Anti-Ro/SSA is the predominant autoantibody, present in about 95% of cases.
Mothers of babies with NLE may be asymptomatic initially or may have Sjögren
syndrome, lupus erythematosus, overlap syndrome or, uncommonly, leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis. When evaluating a young woman with a cutaneous leucocytoclastic
vasculitis, dermatologists should be aware of the possible presence of antibodies
related to NLE. If any patient suffering a disorder related to NLE becomes
pregnant, testing for autoantibodies and close obstetric prenatal care with fetal
echocardiogram is necessary. In cases of fetal bradycardia, treatment with
dexamethasone or betamethasone should be considered, as these drugs are
accessible to the fetal circulation.

An important advance in the description and understanding of congenital heart
block (CHB) came in the 1970s with the observation that mothers of affected
infants frequently had autoimmune diseases and, in particular, that many maternal
sera contained antibodies to SSA/Ro and SSB/La ribonucleoproteins. Although the
molecular biology of the candidate antigens has been extensively defined, the
arrhythmogenic and electrophysiological effects of their cognate antibodies on
the human fetal heart are unknown. In the present study, we provide evidence that
IgG-enriched fractions and anti-52-kD SSA/Ro antibodies affinity-purified from
sera of mothers whose children have CHB induce complete atrioventricular (AV)
block in the human fetal heart perfused by the Langendorff technique and inhibit 
L-type Ca2+ currents at the whole-cell and single-channel level. Immunization of 
female BALB/c mice with recombinant 52-kD SSA/Ro protein generated high-titer
antibodies that crossed the placenta during pregnancy and were associated with
varying degrees of AV conduction abnormalities, including complete AV block, in
the pups. These findings strongly suggest that anti-52-kD SSA/Ro antibodies are
causally related to the development of CHB.

We report a case of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) with congenital heart
block and severe myocardial failure, which was followed from the 25th week of
gestation because of fetal bradycardia. The child was delivered at the 37th week 
of gestation by elective cesarean section because of echocardiographically
documented heart enlargement, pericardial effusion and moderate insufficiency of 
the mitral and tricuspid valves. In spite of immediate pacing, intubation and
supportive treatment, the newborn developed progressive heart failure.
Echocardiography showed endocarditis of the mitral valve and diffuse myocarditis.
The heart failure resolved under steroid treatment. Our experience supports the
early use of steroids in treating myocarditis due to NLE. Intrauterine steroid
treatment in the presence of fetal hydrops and congenital heart block is
discussed.

Our objective was to construct from readily available components a system that
would allow determination of P-wave to P-wave intervals in fetuses with
congenital heart block. Using a fetal monitor, bedside patient monitor, spiral
electrode, and a special cable described herein, we obtained direct fetal
electrocardiograms from two fetuses with autoimmune heart block. Measurement of
the atrial rate was made by determining the P-wave to P-wave interval. These
determinations were compared to atrial rates measured by M-mode echocardiography 
in utero and neonatal electrocardiograms. Atrial rates determined by direct fetal
electrocardiogram were identical to rates obtained by M-mode echocardiography and
within 10 beats/min of rates calculated from neonatal electrocardiograms.
Premature ventricular contractions in one fetus were also detected. It is
possible to perform continuous and accurate assessments of sinoatrial node
activity in fetuses with congenital heart block using components readily
available to most obstetricians.

Complete congenital heart block is a serious complication of neonatal lupus
erythematosus which most often occurs in children of mothers suffering from
connective tissue disease. We report the occurrence of complete congenital heart 
block associated with autoimmune hepatitis (SLA-positive). A 32-year-old woman
was treated for more than 10 years for autoimmune hepatitis (SLA-/ANA-positive)
and remained in clinical remission under immunosuppressive therapy. She showed an
MHC-haplotype typical for autoimmune hepatitis (A1, B8, DR3). After a normal
first pregnancy, an emergency caesarean section was performed in the 32nd week of
her second pregnancy because of fetal bradycardia. The child died a few hours
after delivery of complete congenital AV-block. Retrospective analysis of the
maternal serum showed the emergence of SS-A/Ro-antibodies prior to the second
pregnancy. The maternal serum antibodies were reactive with the 52 kD
SS-A/Ro-antigen, as demonstrated by immunoblot employing recombinant
SSA/Ro-antigen. The occurrence of complete congenital heart block has been shown 
to be associated with the presence of SS-A/Ro antibodies as well as the
MHC-haplotype DR3. With respect to this genetic linkage, pregnant patients with
autoimmune hepatitis and the MHC-haplotype DR3 should be examined for the
presence of SS-A/Ro-antibodies. They should be closely followed during pregnancy 
to enable early detection of the development of congenital heart block, as
prevention by plasmapheresis plus dexamethasone may be possible at an early
stage.

Fetal bradycardia of 60 beats per minute was diagnosed in the 22nd week of a
normal pregnancy. Echocardiography showed a complete fetal atrioventricular heart
block. The fetal heart was without structural abnormalities. Auto-antibodies
(Ro/SS-A and antinuclear antibodies) could be demonstrated in both mother and
child. The mother, however, showed no signs or symptoms of a connective tissue
disease. We describe neonatal lupus erythematosus as an important cause of
congenital heart block.

PURPOSE: To study the pathogenesis, evolution and prognosis of the complete heart
block of the fetus.
METHODS: Bidimensional echocardiography associated to M-mode and doppler was
performed in 600 patients. All cases of congenital heart block were referred
because the fetuses presented hydrops, bradycardia and/or cardiac malformation
suspected by routine ultrasound.
RESULTS: Isolated heart block was found in 6 fetuses (5 cases of complete type
and 1 case of 2nd degree type 2:1). Heart block associated with complex cardiac
disease and left atrial isomerism was found in 6 fetuses with no survivors (5
cases of complete type and 1 case of 2nd degree type 2:1). Heart block associated
with atrioventricular discordante was found in 1 case.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study agree the literature about the relation
between maternal anti-RO antibodies and isolated complete heart block. We also
found a poor prognosis in the group with heart block and complex cardiac
malformations.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus in offspring of mothers with experimental systemic
lupus erythematosus.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) syndrome is a result of the transfer of
autoantibodies produced by the mother, across the placenta, to the fetus. NLE is 
characterized by a transient dermatitis, a variety of systemic and hematological 
abnormalities, and isolated cases of congenital heart block. The latter has been 
reported to be due to the presence of autoantibodies specific to La (SS-B) and/or
Ro (SS-A). As female mice with experimental SLE, induced by immunization with the
monoclonal anti-DNA 16/6 Id, produce a variety of autoantibodies including
anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, we examined the relevance of NLE in the murine
system. Offspring of SLE-afflicted BALB/c mothers possessed antibody titers to
the 16/6 Id, ssDNA, and nuclear extract, which gradually declined until reduced
to normal levels by day 60 after delivery. Antibody titers in the sera of the
mothers remained elevated throughout this period. Electrocardiograms were
recorded from groups of neonates from mothers with experimental SLE. The results 
indicated that a high percentage of the offspring had defects in their conduction
system including first, second, and third degree heart block; significant
bradycardia; and wide QRS complex. Normal patterns were observed in offspring of 
healthy mothers. Experiments done with mice that were exposed to SLE-related
autoantibodies early in their development indicated that offspring to mothers
with experimental SLE were neither protected nor more susceptible to disease
induction by the 16/6 Id.

Steroid therapy for hydrops associated with antibody-mediated congenital heart
block.

Hill 27599-7570.

Evaluation of fetal bradycardia noted during a routine prenatal visit at 24
weeks' gestation in a mother without symptoms showed an antibody-mediated heart
block with anti-La (SSB) antibody present. The fetus had a pericardial effusion
and ascites. After maternal steroid therapy, the ascites resolved and the
pericardial effusion was substantially diminished. Steroid therapy may be a
helpful adjunct for treatment of a premature infant with hydrops as a result of
antibody-mediated heart block.

[Holter monitoring, exercise test and atropine test in isolated congenital
atrioventricular block in children].

Twenty-four patients with isolated congenital heart block were investigated by
24-hour Holter monitoring at an average age of 9.3 +/- 5.5 years. Six patients
were symptomatic and 18 were asymptomatic. Eight asymptomatic patients underwent 
exercise stress tests and an atropine test was performed in 10 asymptomatic
patients to evaluate the capacity to accelerate the heart rate. The symptomatic
patients were older than the asymptomatic patients. None of the parameters which 
analyse ventricular rate were significantly different in the two groups of
patients. Significant ventricular arrhythmias (Lown Grade 2 or over) were
recorded in 1 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic patients. The incidence of these
ventricular arrhythmias increased with age and degree of bradycardia. The
percentage increase in ventricular rate after atropine correlated with what was
observed on effort (r = 0.95, p = 0.01) but there was no relationship between the
ventricular rates during these two tests and those recorded on Holter monitoring.
The results of this series of children with isolated congenital heart block show 
the Holter parameters cannot distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic patients. 
The exercise stress and atropine tests gave very similar results but their
prognostic value has not yet been established.

Congenital heart block is rare; it is acquired in utero, definitive and, more
often than not, complete. It can be diagnosed by the appearance of fetal
bradycardia around the 23rd week of gestation, during ultrasonographic monitoring
of pregnancy. Heart block is usually associated with the presence of anti-Ro
and/or anti-La antibodies in the mother's serum. These maternal immunological
abnormalities can be isolated or associated with an autoimmune disease, usually
systemic lupus erythematosus, but also Sjögren's syndrome, or more rarely still, 
an as yet unclassified connective tissue disease. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies 
cross the placental barrier and react with a fetal heart, leading to acute fetal 
myocarditis by the 17th week of gestation. When severe, it is lethal, otherwise
it can result in degeneration and endocardial fibroelastosis, disrupting
conduction and leading to congenital heart block. The ideal treatment would be
prevention with corticosteroids. When the mother is Ro or La antibody-positive
before pregnancy, elimination of these circulating antibodies can be attempted by
treatment with 0.5 mg/kg body wt/d of prednisolone for 3 months. If the treatment
is successful, corticotherapy can be prescribed early in the pregnancy to try to 
protect the fetus. However, there is not always a relationship between maternal
anti-Ro antibodies and fetal heart block. If the Ro/La antibody-positive woman is
already pregnant, but before her 17th week, it is possible to prescribe
dexamethasone, which crosses the placenta and remains active, sometimes in
association with plasmapheresis.

Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiographic evaluation of fetal arrhythmia.

Crowley DC, Dick M, Rayburn WF, Rosenthal A.

Cardiac anatomy and rhythm were evaluated in the fetuses of 18 pregnant women
(between 20 and 42 weeks of gestation) referred because of abnormal fetal heart
rate or rhythm. Utilizing a 3 MHz two-dimensional scan head with M-mode
capability, M-mode recordings were obtained at paper speeds of 50 and 100 mm/s
from 16 fetuses. The arrhythmia of two fetuses was diagnosed using
two-dimensional echo alone. Semilunar and atrioventricular valve opening and
closing points, A waves, plus ventricular wall motion were used for timing
purposes; and heart rate and rhythm were determined. Diagnoses made were atrial
premature beats n = 3, ventricular premature beats n = 3, congenital heart block 
n = 4, supraventricular tachycardia n = 3, sinus bradycardia n = 1, and blocked
atrial beats n = 1. In three fetuses no arrhythmia was identified. Cardiac
anatomy was normal in 16 fetuses, with two (congenital heart block) felt to have 
univentricular hearts. Fourteen pregnancies went to term, two were delivered
prematurely, and two fetuses with congenital heart block were stillborn. In three
fetuses arrhythmia was confirmed during labor by fetal scalp electrode.
Arrhythmia was absent after birth in 11 of 16 infants, with congenital heart
block persistent in two infants, and supraventricular tachycardia, atrial
premature beats, and blocked atrial premature beats remaining in one each.
Intervention with medical management was attempted in four pregnancies, with
successful termination of arrhythmia supraventricular tachycardia) in two
fetuses. We conclude that combined two-dimensional M-mode capability is useful in
the diagnosis of fetal rhythm disturbances, and perhaps in the selection of
timing, and mode of intervention.

[Congenital heart block in a newborn infant born to a mother with lupus
erythematosus].

[Article in Spanish]

Jiménez R, Figueras J, Botet F, Cruz M.

We report a case of a newborn with a congenital heart-block. Clinical picture
began with bradycardia and heart failure from birth. The mother had a systemic
lupus erythematosus in remission during pregnancy suffering a reactivation after 
delivery. This report deals about the greater incidence of congenital heart-block
in the lupus-mother's newborns and we expose some etiopathogenic hypothesis. Also
we point-out the easy clinical and electrocardiographic diagnosis that shows a
third degree heart-block with atrioventricular dissociation and atrial frequency 
two or three times greater than ventricular. It's established the differential
diagnosis among neonatal bradycardias and congenital heart-blocks. The treatment 
with isoproterenol was ineffective. A pacemaker was need.

Maternal systemic lupus erythematosus associated with fetal congenital heart
block. A case report.

Moore PJ.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is a rare cause of fetal bradycardia and, if
misinterpreted as fetal distress, may lead to detrimental obstetric intervention.
There is a definite association between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as
well as other connective tissue disorders in the mother and CHB in her offspring.
A case of CHB in the child of a mother with asymptomatic SLE is reported and a
useful diagnostic investigation, the sonar-atropine test, is described.

Heterotopic epithelial replacement (so-called "mesothelioma") of the
atrioventricular node, congenital heart block, and sudden death.

Lie JT, Lufschanowski R, Erickson EE.

Heterotopic epithelial replacement (so-called "mesothelioma") of the
atrioventricular node is a rare cause of congenital heart block and sudden death;
only about 50 cases have been reported in the literature in predominantly female 
patients ranging in age from infancy to 86 years. The lesion is virtually
impossible to diagnose clinically and can be recognized at postmortem only by
histologic examination of the atrioventricular conduction tissue. A unique case
is reported since the patient, a young, asymptomatic woman, was chosen by chance 
as the subject of an electrophysiologic study of bradycardia 6 years before her
sudden death. The morphologic (light- and electron-microscopic) findings of the
atrioventricular node studied at autopsy were supportive of heterotopic
epithelial origin of the lesion. The disputed histogenesis is briefly discussed.

Antenatal detection of fetal A-V dissociation utilizing real-time B-mode
ultrasound.

Platt LD, Manning FA, Gray C, Guttenburg M, Turkel SB.

Congenital heart block is an unusual cause of fetal bradycardia. Until recently, 
the diagnosis could be confirmed only by evaluation of the fetal cardiac
electrical activity. Two cases are reported in which the diagnosis of
atrio-ventricular (A-V) dissociation was confirmed in the antepartum period by
real-time ultrasound evaluation of cardiac mechanical activity.

The syndromes of familial atrioventricular block with sinus bradycardia:
prognostic indices, electrophysiologic and histopathologic correlates.

Schneider MD, Roller DH, Morganroth J, Josephson ME.

A family with adult onset heart block (AOHB) and sinus bradycardia (SB) was
investigated 5 yr after previous study. A 44-yr-old female previously 'normal'
presented ECG evidence of 1st-degree and 2nd-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) 
with normal intraventricular conduction and episodic 3rd-degree AVB. His bundle
electrocardiography (HBE) demonstrated A--H prolongation (245msec) with normal
H--V time during sinus rhythm and 3rd-degree AV nodal block with a His bundle
escape rhythm. Sinus node function served in first-order relatives. HBE and sinus
node function were normal in a 38-yr-old sister with new SB. 37 families with
familial 3rd-degree AVB were reviewed with attention to prognostic indices and
electrophysiologic-pathologic correlates. The incidence of conduction
abnormalities supported an autosomal dominant transmission with variable
penetrance. Subsidiary pacemaker rate and QRS morphology showed no discriminative
value with respect to prognosis. HBS identified A--H prolongation in 2 patients
with AOHB and 2 with AOHB and SB, with coexistent H--V conduction delay in 2
cases of AOHB and SB with abnormal QRS morphology. Histopathology was variable,
but the finding of multiple lesions in 2 of 5 patients with congenital heart
block and each of 2 with AOHB and SB suggests that mixed conduction system
disease is prevalent in familial heart block.

[Article in German]

Methfessel G, Methfessel HD, Wagner G.

In a pregnant woman of 20 years is recorded a foetal bradycardia of 60 beats per 
minute in the 33. week of pregnancy. The woman too had an influenza. The
cardiological examination shows a congenital complete heart block. After
spontaneous delivery of a male infant at date the heart block persists for more
than 7 months. There are are no malformations; a interdependence with
influenza-infection of the mother is not to be proved. The diagnosis of the
congenital heart block is rare. Of 40 cases pointed out in the literature only 3 
cases has been diagnosed before the 35. week of pregnancy.

Fetal bradycardia without fetal distress: case presentation and review of the
literature.

Webster RD, Cudmore DW, Gray J.

A case of a term pregnancy with a persistent fetal heart rate of 65 to 80
beats/min is presented. Initially this was presumed to be due to congenital heart
block. Subsequent fetal ECG revealed blocked atrial extrasystoles. Review of the 
literature showed 31 previously reported cases of heart block diagnosed in utero.
A review of this literature is discussed and the importance of differentiating
bradycardia due to heart block from bradycardia due to fetal distress is
emphasized.
