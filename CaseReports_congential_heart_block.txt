RATIONALE: Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is an infrequent disease caused by 
transplacental maternal autoantibodies. The most common effects of NLE include
cutaneous involvement and congenital heart block (CHB), although it might involve
multiple organs, such as the liver, lungs, blood, and nervous or digestive
systems. Izmirly PM1 and Tonello et al recently reported cutaneous manifestations
of neonatal lupus and risk of subsequent CHB. The most serious complication of
NLE is complete atrioventricular (AV) block.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We experienced 2 cases of NLE that were diagnosed in the past
year in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. These cases showed 2 different clinical
spectrums (CHB, multisystemic effects). One case was a 32-week pregnant woman
with combined liver damage and fever, and her fetus was premature due to
bradycardia and pericardial effusion. The second case was a young pregnant woman 
who had systemic lupus erythematosus for 2 years and had been taking
methylprednisolone and hydroxychloroquine for a long time since her illness. When
prenatal testing at 28 weeks of pregnancy showed that the fetus had CHB, the
mother began taking dexamethasone.
DIAGNOSIS: The first case was diagnosed as NLE with CHB after birth, while the
second was diagnosed as NLE with CHB, ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect
when she was born at 34 weeks.
INTERVENTIONS: Both of 2 cases were treated with steroids, intravenous
immunoglobulin, and a diuretic. But the second case was treated with isoprenaline
in addition to the above.
OUTCOMES: Both of the infants was followed up and found to be clinically normal. 
During the clinic follow-up of the first case, the 8-month-old infant was still
asymptomatic with normal growth and development. Her heart rate fluctuated from
40 to 90 beats/minute.
LESSONS: Autoimmune CHB is a severe, potentially life-threatening disorder
associated with passive transfer of maternal anti-Sjogren's syndrome A/Ro and
anti-Sjogren's syndrome B/La autoantibodies. Mothers who are positive for these
autoantibodies are recommended to have serial echocardiography and obstetric
ultrasonography from the early second trimester. Newborns should be delivered at 
an early stage of gestation if there is evidence of pericardial effusion,
ascites, increasing ventricular ectopy, reduced ventricular shortening fraction, 
or AV valve regurgitation. Aggressive medical management after birth should be
coupled with pacemaker implantation in infants who do not respond to medical
therapies alone.

Complete heart block (CHB) is infrequently encountered during pregnancy. Its
management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving the obstetrician,
cardiologist, anesthetist and neonatologist. It varies from conservative,
temporary or permanent pacemaker (PPM) insertion (either during the antenatal,
intrapartum or postpartum period). We present the case of a 30-year-old, gravida 
2 para 1 at the 36-week period of amenorrhea (POA) with congenital CHB. She was
asymptomatic throughout her pregnancy despite having a pulse rate between 40 and 
50 beats per minute. She delivered a healthy boy via cesarean section due to
breech presentation after a failed external cephalic version. A temporary
pacemaker was inserted prior to delivery. However, she required permanent
insertion of pacemaker during the postpartum period.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB) is a condition in which the
atria and ventricles beat independently of each other. CCAVB cases require
permanent pacemaker implantation until adulthood. Nevertheless, consensus
regarding postnatal medical therapy for bradycardia has not been reached. Here we
report the case of a newborn with CCAVB, whose intractable bradycardia was
successfully treated with transdermal tulobuterol. Tulobuterol is a selective
β2-adrenoceptor agonist, widely used safely as bronchodilator in children. It
also has positive inotropic and chronotropic effect via β1-adrenoceptors. We
believe the tulobuterol patch can be used as an optional therapy for CCAVB where 
pacemaker implantation is not available.

Permanent cardiac pacing is the only effective solution for patients with
symptomatic bradycardia and heart block. About 10% of patients undergoing
implantation of the conventional pacing system develop complications related to
the subcutaneous pocket or the leads and in pediatric patients lead problems may 
rise in up to 30% of the patients. The leadless pacemaker devices were developed 
in order to minimize some of those complications. We present a case of an
11-year-old patient who presented after the sudden death of his older brother,
with recurrent episodes of syncope and documented prolonged sinus pauses. The
patient underwent percutaneous implantation of a leadless Micra™ pacemaker device
with optimal results.

An extremely rare clinical entity: congenitally corrected transposition with
situs ınversus and single coronary artery presented with complete
atrioventricular block in a young man.

Hospital,University of Health Science,Trabzon,Turkey.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries is a rare form of CHD.
Situs inversus is a much less common variant of a congenitally corrected
transposition of the great arteries. In rare cases, transposition events may be
accompanied by various cardiac anomalies. However, situs inversus patients with
congenitally corrected transposition, single coronary artery anomaly, and
atrioventricular block together have not been reported previously. This
combination of abnormalities is presented as a first in the literature.

Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan Province, China.

RATIONALE: Brugada syndrome (BrS) is a cardiac ion channel disease that is caused
by an autosomal dominant genetic abnormality. A ventricular septal defect is a
common congenital heart disease, in which genetic defects play a significant
role.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We report an extremely rare case of a 42-year-old male with
congenital heart disease, who suffered recurrent syncope and gastrointestinal
bleeding. His electrocardiogram showed an unusual right bundle branch block-like 
pattern and ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was eventually diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome Combined
with a Ventricular Septal Defect.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with ICD implants.
OUTCOMES: We extracted his blood and performed whole exome sequencing. Whole
exome sequencing revealed mutations in genes, which encode ion channels and
proteins important for embryonic heart development. However, a novel mutation in 
the SCN5A gene was also found.
LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first genetically proven case of BrS
combined with a ventricular septal defect.

Maternal autoantibodies to Ro/SSA are often linked to congenital heart block and 
rarely associated with structural defects. We describe the case of a fetus with
anti-Ro-mediated second-degree block at 19 weeks, which progressed to a complete 
block, fibroelastosis, atrioventricular valve insufficiency, and semilunar valve 
stenosis/insufficiency at 20, 22, 24, and 26 weeks, respectively, although the
fetus received transplacental anti-arrhythmic drugs. The 2150-g fetus was
vaginally delivered at 35 weeks. An external pacemaker was inserted immediately
after birth and replaced with permanent pacemaker at the age of 3 months. The
newborn has had a good outcome with well-controlled heart rate.

While the relationship between maternal connective tissue diseases and neonatal
rashes was described in the 1960s and congenital heart block in the 1970s, the
"culprit" antibody reactivity to the SSA/Ro-SSB/La ribonucleoprotein complex was 
not identified until the 1980s. However, studies have shown that approximately
10-15% of cases of congenital heart block are not exposed to anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La. 
Whether those cases represent a different disease entity or whether another
antibody is associated has yet to be determined. Moreover, the cutaneous
manifestations of neonatal lupus have also been identified in infants exposed
only to anti-U1RNP antibodies. In this review, we describe what we believe to be 
the first case of congenital heart block exposed to maternal anti-U1RNP
antibodies absent anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La. The clinical and pathologic characteristics
of this fetus are compared to those typically seen associated with SSA/Ro and
SSB/La. Current guidelines for fetal surveillance are reviewed and the potential 
impact conferred by this case is evaluated.

INTRODUCTION: Ebstein's anomaly is the most commonly occurring congenital defect 
associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. In patients with Ebstein's
anomaly and supraventricular tachycardia, the absence of right bundle branch
block (RBBB) in sinus rhythm is a highly sensitive and specific indicator of the 
presence of an ipsilateral accessory AP.
CASE: We present an electrophysiology case of a patient with Ebstein's anomaly
and 3 ipsilateral accessory pathways. After ablation was performed, RBBB was
evident.
CONCLUSION: In patients with Ebstein's anomaly and supraventricular tachycardia, 
the absence of a RBBB pattern in the surface ECG after RFCA should raise
suspicion for the presence of multiple accessory pathways.

It is currently recommended that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) be maintained during
pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Recent data suggest that
this Toll-like receptor inhibitor may also reduce the recurrence rate of
anti-SSA/Ro associated congenital heart block (CHB). This case report describes a
unique situation in which a CHB-afflicted, HCQ-exposed pregnancy was electively
terminated. The heart did not reveal any characteristic features of
cardiotoxicity, providing further evidence supporting the safety of foetal
exposure to HCQ.

Right ventricular (RV) pacing can be associated with impairment of left
ventricular (LV) function due to electrical dyssynchrony and myocardial
remodeling (Janousek et al. in J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 15:470-474, 2004).
RV-pacing induced ventricular dysfunction is reversible by techniques such as
biventricular pacing and LV apical or LV free wall pacing or turning the
pacemaker off which have all been shown to restore synchrony and improve left
ventricular function (Janousek et al. in J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol 15:470-474, 
2004; Geldorp et al. in Heart Fail Rev 16:305-314, 2011). We describe an infant
with RV-pacing induced cardiomyopathy who improved when the pacing rate was
reduced thus demonstrating the relationship between pacing rate and development
of LV dysfunction.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB) is a rare condition with an
incidence of 1 of 20,000 live births. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)
occurs more frequently than CCAVB and occurs in 1 of 5000 live births. HLHS in
association with CCAVB is exceedingly rare. In this report, we describe a rare
case of HLHS and CCAVB diagnosed in utero. Postnatal diagnosis, management and
outcome are presented as well as review of the medical literature.

Spontaneous Remission of Congenital Complete Atrioventricular Block in Anti-Ro/La
Antibody-Negative Monozygotic Twins: Case Report.

Cardiovascular Surgery Center and Research Hospital, İstanbul, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Congenital complete atrioventricular block without any structural
heart disease and anti-Ro/La negativity is very rare. Discordant complete
atrioventricular block, which is more frequently defined in the literature as an 
autoimmune mechanism, is much more rare in monozygotic twins.
CASE REPORT: The 26-year-old healthy mother had given birth in her first
spontaneous, uneventful pregnancy to monozygotic twins at week 35. While the
first twin's physical examination proved her to be normal with a pulse rate
consistent with her age, the second twin had a pulse rate of approximately 40
beats/minute.The patient was confirmed to have congenital complete
atrioventricular block.
CONCLUSION: Despite this case appears to be an isolated one, a discordant
complete atrioventricular block regression without any autoimmune evidence should
be included in the differential diagnosis of bradycardia in infants.

Junctional ectopic tachycardia(JET) is a rare childhood arrhythmia originating
from the area adjacent to the atrioventricular(AV) node. It often occurs after
surgical procedures like repair of Tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal
defect and ventricular septal defect, which are all performed in that area. While
AV block (AVB) can occur after JET, it is very rare for late JET occurring after 
early postoperative AVB to be followed by normal sinus rhythm (NSR). There is no 
information in the literature related to the pathophysiology of this phenomenon. 
In this text, we present 4 patients who developed complete AV block(CAVB) in the 
early postoperative period (within the first 24h) after JET in late period (>72h)
and returned to NSR with first-degree AV block and then NSR during follow-up.
Based on these cases, we hypothesize that there is a link between late JET after 
early postoperative CAVB and return to NSR.

Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province, china.

BACKGROUND: Dextrocardia, or right-lying heart, is an uncommon congenital heart
disease in which the apex of the heart is located on the right side of chest.
Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVA) is a rare venous anomaly that is often
associated with the abnormalities of cardiac transduction system. A case with
combination of dextrocardia, persistent left superior vena cava, and sick sinus
syndrome has not been reported.
METHODS: We used different techniques including cardiac color Doppler
echocardiography, 24-hour Holter monitoring, and abdominal ultrasound to make a
diagnosis and treated the patient by implanting a VVI pacemaker.
RESULTS: A 50-year-old woman was admitted with a syncope. Angiography of the
right atrium and superior vena cava, echocardiography, electrocardiography, and
abdominal ultrasound revealed the presence of the combination of mirror image
dextrocardia, PLSVA, and sick sinus syndrome. The complex structural anomalies
presented great technical challenges for interventional treatments. After
thorough examination and understanding of the structural anatomy and anomalies of
the superior and inferior vena cava and cardiac chambers, we successfully treated
this patient by implanting a VVI pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: Physicians must be aware of the complexity of the morphological and
anatomical structures of dextrocardia accompanying PLSVC. Given that the
diagnosis of situs inversus was performed at a relatively advanced age, it is
therefore important to make such a correct diagnosis followed by appropriate
therapeutic intervention.

Intracardiac bronchogenic cysts are uncommon congenital tumors, which rarely
become symptomatic. We describe a rare case of bronchogenic cyst in the
atrioventricular node. A 36-year-old man with third-degree atrioventricular block
was referred to our hospital. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a cystic
mass at the right atrial aspect of the low interatrial septum. He underwent
surgical resection of the mass, and a permanent epicardium pacemaker was
implanted. His postoperative course was uneventful. Microscopic examination
showed a cyst surrounded by ciliated columnar epithelium and partially smooth
muscle, and the histopathological diagnosis was bronchogenic cyst.

Atrioventricular (AV) block in the neonatal period is a rare disorder. It is
frequently associated with underlying structural congenital heart disease and
maternal lupus. Presently described is premature baby who developed 2:1 AV block 
and congestive heart failure due to hypocalcemia. Dramatic clinical improvement
was observed following treatment of intravenous 10% calcium gluconate. Therefore,
it is suggested that serum calcium level of newborns with AV block and congestive
heart failure be measured.

Isolated Left Subclavian Artery, Complete Atrioventricular Block, and Tricuspid
Atresia in a Neonate.

Chaturvedi K, Prasad D, Ashwath R, Strainic JP, Snyder CS.

Isolated left subclavian artery is one of the rarer aortic arch anomalies. It has
been associated with other congenital heart diseases, typically tetralogy of
Fallot, double-outlet right ventricle, and atrial and ventricular septal defects.
Its significant clinical implications include a left-to-right shunt from the
vertebrobasilar system, which causes pulmonary overcirculation and subclavian
steal. We present an unusual case of a premature infant who was diagnosed
prenatally with congenital complete atrioventricular block and tricuspid atresia 
and was found to have an isolated left subclavian artery postnatally. The patient
underwent implantation of a permanent single-chamber epicardial pacing system. To
our knowledge, this combination of lesions has not been reported-and in our case,
it influenced our surgical planning.

Pentalogy of Fallot is a cyanotic congenital heart disease that has guarded
prognosis without surgical intervention in infancy. Women with uncorrected
defects rarely survive into childbearing age and pregnancy in this group is
associated with a high rate of perinatal loss. Physiological cardiovascular
changes in pregnancy can lead to maternal haemodynamic instability with
subsequent adverse cardiac sequelae with or without fetal decompensation. Optimum
management and pregnancy outcomes in mother with uncorrected Pentalogy of Fallot 
and twin pregnancy have not been described in the literature. We describe a
successful case of monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy in an affected woman
who has not undergone surgical repair. Her pregnancy progressed without any
adverse cardiopulmonary complications. Her caesarean delivery and postpartum
recovery were favourable, with successful birth of two healthy babies at
35.7 weeks. This case emphasises the importance of a multidisciplinary team,
especially of obstetricians with expertise in high-risk pregnancies, adult
congenital heart disease cardiologists and anaesthesiologist.

In Down syndrome, so far, has not been reported it's association with congenital 
heart block, this entity is rare and occurred in only 1% of mothers who have
systemic lupus erythematosus, the presence of anti-Ro antibodies cross the
placenta presenting neonatal lupus with skin lesions and congenital heart block, 
bradycardia, which is why we describe the following case. This is a new male end 
product of asymptomatic young mother, but serological birth with stigmata of Down
syndrome, birth presents congenital bradycardia rare manifestation abnormalities,
but common in children of mothers with lupus are initiated study protocol,
realizing you including laboratory tests and immunological studies cabinet as
electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, which gave tone to take the mother

Author information: 
(1)Professor Salma Rouf, Professor, Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Dhaka
Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Congenital complete heart block presenting for the first time in pregnancy is a
rare occurrence posing a therapeutic challenge. We present a case of unpaced
preexisting congenital complete heart block in pregnancy diagnosed for the first 
time during routine prenatal care at her early weeks of gestation. Our patient
was asymptomatic and haemodynamically stable and was managed conservatively with 
a multidisciplinary term approach. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was
present and she was delivered by ceasarean section at term for foetal distress
with IUGR. Prophylactic temporary pacing was done before surgery and was weaned
off in the early postpartum period. When a multidisciplinary approach is used
both maternal and neonatal outcome are favorable. We review the literature in an 
attempt to discuss the therapeutic policy for such patients.

Immune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss may complicate systemic autoimmune
diseases. We have previously reported the presence of antibodies directed against
inner ear antigens in patients with Cogan syndrome, a disease characterized by
sudden hearing loss and interstitial keratitis. Such autoantibodies cross-react
with an epitope of SSA/Ro60 protein. Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in pregnant women
cross the placenta and reach the fetal tissues inducing an immune-mediated damage
of the cardiac conduction system. We wanted to evaluate whether mothers with
anti-Ro/SSA antibodies who gave birth to children with congenital heart block
have antibodies directed against inner ear antigens and whether these antibodies 
are connected with the presence of immune-mediated sensorineural hearing loss. We
did not find anti-inner ear antibodies in the majority of the mothers. On the
contrary a 13-year-old boy with congenital heart block and sensorineural hearing 
loss was positive for the presence of anti-inner ear antigens antibodies.
Moreover his serum was positive for the presence of anti-Ro60 peptide antibodies 
but did not recognize the entire protein Ro60 (TROVE2), a behaviour similar to
that of sera from patients with Cogan syndrome. In conclusion the data obtained
so far show that anti-inner ear antibodies do not recognize the entire protein
TROVE2 and do not support the hypothesis that such antibodies may be involved in 
the pathogenesis of congenital heart block.

BACKGROUND: Congenital complete heart block is a life-threatening condition which
is highly associated with autoimmune and connective tissue disorders. Presence of
maternal autoantibodies for associated conditions increases the risk of
delivering a child with congenital complete heart block, however, less than a
half of all women with such antibodies are symptomatic even after delivery.
Mortality rate is highest during the neonatal period (45 %) and about two-thirds 
of all cases will require permanent pacing at some point in their lives.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of isolated complete heart block in a
5-year-old HIV-free girl of African descent born to an HIV-infected woman with no
prior history of autoimmune disorders. She was referred to us with chief
complaints of recurrent syncopal attacks and effort intolerance since birth. A
physical examination was unremarkable except for her being small for her age
(body mass index 16.3 kg/m2) and bradycardia. Her vital signs were within
acceptable range with the exception of her pulse rate, which ranged between 22
and 34 beats/minute. An echocardiogram revealed a sinus bradycardia, otherwise a 
structurally normal heart. An electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular
dissociation in keeping with third-degree atrioventricular block. The child
underwent a permanent epicardial pacemaker insertion and has been symptom-free
following pacing.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its infrequency and life-threatening potential, patients
with congenital complete heart block have an excellent survival rate with timely 
diagnosis and intervention. An incidental detection of bradycardia in a fetus
during routine obstetrical ultrasound examination should increase the index of
suspicion for congenital complete heart block and warrant a screening for
associated maternal autoantibodies.

In patients presenting with complete atrioventricular (AV) block, the common
causes are degeneration of the conduction system, acute myocardial infarction,
congenital and metabolic disorders (such as azotemia). However, at times, no
cause can be ascribed and the label congenital or degenerative is applied
depending on the patient's age and the QRS complex width. We present two cases of
patients with complete AV block, who were subsequently found to have rare
etiologies - sarcoidosis (with isolated feature of AV block) and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.

Myxedema Coma Secondary to Central Hypothyroidism: A Rare but Real Cause of
Altered Mental Status in Pediatrics.

Thompson MD(1), Henry RK.

Author information: 
(1)Section of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes, Nationwide Children's
Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA.

BACKGROUND: Myxedema coma (MC), a medical emergency defined as severe
hypothyroidism leading to altered mental status, is more common in older women
with hypothyroidism.
METHODS/RESULTS: A 7-year-old Caucasian male with chromosome 1q deletion
presented with altered mental status preceded by milestone regression. His
presenting labs results were: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.501 μIU/ml and 
free thyroxine (T4) <0.5 ng/dl. His morning cortisol level was 8.1 μg/dl with
repeat testing, while TSH was 1.119 μIU/ml and free T4 was 0.5 ng/dl. Low-dose
cosyntropin test showed baseline and peak cortisol levels of 1.9 and 16 μg/dl,
respectively. Aside from altered mental status, heart block was present in
addition to hypothermia and hypercarbia. Diffuse cerebral cortical and corpus
callosum atrophy were seen on MRI. An intravenous (i.v.) stress dose of
hydrocortisone was administered for 24 h prior to an i.v. loading dose of
levothyroxine. His activity level subsequently returned to baseline within 48 h
after treatment had been initiated.
CONCLUSION: Though MC is rare, occurring mainly with noncompliance in primary
hypothyroidism, it may occur at the diagnosis of secondary hypothyroidism. Based 
on features like hypothermia, hypoventilation, and cardiovascular instability
occurring in the setting of central hypothyroidism, it should be suspected and
managed urgently in order to avert the associated high mortality resulting from
treatment delays.

The prevalence of adults with congenital heart disease has dramatically increased
during the last decades due to significant advances in the surgical correction of
these conditions. As a result, patient's survival has been prolonged and
arrhythmias have become one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality
for these patients. The surface 12-lead ECG may play a critical role in the
identification of the underlying heart disease of the patient, the recognition of
the arrhythmia mechanism and may also help in the planification of the ablation
procedure in this setting. Finally, important prognostic information can be also 
obtained from the ECG in these patients. The present review will offer an
overview of the principal utilities of the surface ECG in the diagnosis and
management of patients with CHD and arrhythmias.

An infrequent but devastating late complication of Fontan circulation is
protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), which results from unbalanced lymphatic
homeostasis. Surgical decompression of the thoracic duct by redirecting its
drainage to the pulmonary venous atrium has been introduced recently as a
possible treatment. This report describes a single-institution experience with
this innovative procedure in 2 patients with failing Fontan circulation with PLE 
refractory to optimized medical therapy.

Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) have been associated with several
phenotypes ranging from systemic to prevalent of muscle, heart, skin, nerve etc. 
More recently they have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and
severe forms of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). We report
four novel mutations - 3 missense and 1 deletion - in 4 unrelated patients
showing different phenotypes, ranging from the early onset congenital form of
laminopathy to classical LGMD phenotype, to LGMD and heart involvement. All these
newly identified variants were not found in 300 ethnicallymatched control
subjects. The variant c.103-105del CTG was described post-mortem in a young
patient with congenital muscular dystrophy who presented at the age of 9 a first 
degree A-V block and subsequently several episodes of supraventricular
parossystic tachycardia. Two patients presented as onset symptom lower limbs
muscle weakness, and developed heart conduction defects requiring pacemaker
implantation at the age of 26 and 38 years, respectively. One of them who carried
the mutation c.1339G>C died at the age of 40 by intractable heart failure; the
second one carrying the mutation 265C>T died at the age of 30, for a trmboembolic
event. A classical LGMD phenotype without heart involvement was observed in the
patient with the mutation 1579C>T, who died at the age of 68 years for
respiratory insufficiency.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block is a known lethal condition. Although 
antenatal diagnosis and the technical advances of pacemaker treatment have
reduced its mortality, treatment of premature babies with significant myocardial 
damage remains a challenge. In this paper, we report the case of a premature
low-birth-weight infant with congenital complete atrioventricular block and
extremely low ventricular rate, fetal hydrops, and myocarditis who was
successfully treated with staged permanent pacemaker implantation.

Permanent pacemaker lead-induced tricuspid regurgitation is extremely uncommon.
We report a patient with severe tricuspid stenosis detected 10 years after
permanent single chamber pacemaker implantation in surgically corrected
congenital heart disease. The loop at the level of the tricuspid valve may have
caused endothelial injury and eventually led to stenosis. Percutaneous balloon
valvotomy for such stenosis has not been reported from India.

Absent Left Main Coronary Artery and Separate Ostia of Left Coronary System in a 
Patient with Holt-Oram Syndrome and Sinus Node Dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) is a rare but significant syndrome
consisting of structural heart defects, conduction abnormalities, and upper
extremity anomalies. It was first described in the British Heart Journal in 1960 
by Mary Holt and Samuel Oram as a report of atrial septal defect, conduction
disturbances, and hand malformations occurring in family members. Patients can
present with heart blocks or symptoms of underlying congenital heart defects.
CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man with Holt-Oram syndrome presented with
seizure-like activity and was found to have an underlying conduction disturbance.
Physical exam showed bilateral atrophic upper extremities with anatomic
disfiguration, and weakness of the intrinsic hand muscles. Cardiovascular exam
revealed a slow heart rate with irregular rhythm. EKG showed sinus arrest with
junctional escape rhythm. Cardiac catheterization revealed coronary anomalies,
including absent left main coronary artery and separate ostia of the left
anterior ascending and left circumflex coronary artery. Coronary arteries were
patent. Following electrophysiology study, sick sinus syndrome and AV block were 
diagnosed, and the patient received implantation of a permanent pacemaker.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient presented with a seizure-like episode attributed to
hypoxia during asystole from an underlying cardiac conduction defect associated
with Holt-Oram syndrome. Arrhythmias and heart blocks are seen in these patients,
and conduction defects are highly associated with congenital heart defects.
Holt-Oram syndrome rarely presents with coronary artery anomalies. There is no
reported case of separate coronary ostia and absent left main coronary artery.
Prompt diagnosis is important since anomalies in coronary and upper extremity
vasculature might be challenging for invasive procedures.

BACKGROUND: Congenital atrioventricular block is a well-established immunologic
complication of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus. We sought to further
characterize the electrophysiological manifestations of maternal systemic lupus
erythematosus on neonatal atria.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Cases of isolated congenital atrioventricular block treated 
at our center over the past 41 years were identified. Data were extracted from
clinical charts, pacemaker interrogations, ECGs, echocardiograms, and
histopathological reports, when available. Of 31 patients with isolated
congenital atrioventricular block, 18 were negative for maternal antibodies and
had normal epicardial atrial sensing and pacing thresholds. In contrast, 12 of 13
patients with positive maternal antibodies had epicardial pacemakers, 5 (42%) of 
whom had left atrial (LA) inexcitability and/or atrial conduction delay. In 3
patients, the LA could not be captured despite high-output pacing. The fourth
patient had acutely successful LA appendage and left ventricular lead placement. 
At early follow-up, an increased delay between the surface P-wave and
intracardiac atrial depolarization was observed, indicative of atrial conduction 
delay. The fifth patient exhibited LA lead dysfunction, with atrial under-sensing
and an increased capture threshold, 2 weeks after implantation. Biopsies of LA
appendages performed in 2 patients showed no evidence of atrial fibrosis or loss 
of atrial myocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we report previously undescribed yet prevalent
electrophysiological ramifications of maternal systemic lupus erythematosus,
which extend beyond congenital atrioventricular block to encompass alterations in
LA conduction, including LA inexcitability. These manifestations can complicate
epicardial pacemaker implantation in newborns. In the absence of histological
evidence of extensive atrial fibrosis, immune-mediated functional impairment of
electrical activity is suspected.

BACKGROUND: The retinoid acitretin, which has been approved as an effective
therapy for severe keratinization disorders, is highly teratogenic, and exposure 
in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with the risk of miscarriage
and various malformations, including congenital heart defects. Cardiac conduction
system disorders have not been described so far.
CASE REPORT: A 24-year-old woman was treated with acitretin for dyskeratosis
follicularis until pregnancy was diagnosed at 12 weeks of gestation. The female
infant was born after 35 weeks gestation by cesarean section because of
intermittent fetal bradycardia. The baby was vigorous at birth (Apgar 9, 10, 10
at 1, 5 and 10 min) but displayed intermittent third-degree atrioventricular
block. A search for maternal autoantibodies and viral infections gave negative
findings.
CONCLUSION: The spectrum of disorders caused by intrauterine retinoid exposure
appears to include atrioventricular conduction failure.

Bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital cardiac malformation,
affecting 1%-2% of the population. Among various complications, incidence of
infective endocarditis (IE) in the bicuspid aortic valve population is high with 
higher rate of periannular extension resulting in conduction disturbances. Here
we are reporting a rare case of infective endocarditis of bicuspid aortic valve
presented with alternating bundle branch block.

Sciences and Research, New Delhi, India.

Persistent fetal bradycardia in early pregnancy is a rare finding and indicates
towards congenital heart block. This is commonly associated with positive
maternal anti-Ro/anti-La antibodies. A case of an asymptomatic primigravida with 
persistent fetal bradycardia on routine antenatal ultrasound is reported with
special emphasis on its management options.

An uncommon case of isolated parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve in an adult.

Mochizuki Y, Tanaka H, Fukuda Y, Hirata K.

A 31-year-old asymptomatic male was referred to hospital for an examination of
right bundle brunch block. Both, transthoracic and transesophageal
echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular function, and two
different-sized papillary muscles; the anterolateral muscle was more pronounced, 
with almost major chordae tendineae inserted into this dominant muscle, whereas
the immature, flat posteromedial papillary muscle had very short chordae
tendineae and was located higher in the left ventricle, inserted directly into
the mitral annulus. The mitral valve orifice was eccentrically located at the
lateral side, but no significant mitral stenosis or regurgitation was observed.
No other congenital heart anomalies were identified. Thus, the final diagnosis
was isolated parachute-like asymmetric mitral valve (PLAMV), without any other
congenital heart anomalies. The patient was followed up closely with periodic
echocardiographic examinations. Parachute mitral valve is a rare congenital
cardiac defect characterized by focalized attachment of the chordae tendineae of 
both leaflets to a single papillary muscle. In contrast to true parachute mitral 
valve, PLAMV has two separate papillary muscles, one of which is more pronounced 
and into which all chordae are inserted. PLAMV was highly associated with other
congenital heart anomalies, and the involved dominant muscle was most frequently 
a posteromedial papillary muscle. Isolated PLAMV in an adult is even more rare,
while the presence of an immature posteromedial papillary muscle--as in the
present case--is extremely rare.

We present the sonographic features of a second-trimester fetus diagnosed with a 
bradyarrhythmia at 19 weeks' gestation. The mother carried a diagnosis of Sjögren
syndrome, including the presence of SSA and SSB antibodies. Ultrasound M-mode and
fetal echocardiogram revealed the etiology of the bradycardia to be a complete
fetal congenital heart block, likely due to transplacental passage of autoimmune 
anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies. Consequential to the congenital heart
block, the fetus developed hydrops fetalis at 21 weeks' gestational age. We
discuss the 2 major etiologies of congenital heart block and the implications in 
subsequent pregnancies.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare multisystem disorder
characterized by autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which often manifests as
failure to maintain ventilatory homeostasis during sleep. We present a case with 
a third degree atrioventricular block in a young woman with CCHS, which to our
knowledge has not been seen before. As sudden death is known to occur among
patients with CCHS, and it is under consideration to offer regularly monitoring
of patients throughout childhood and adolescence.

We describe management of a patient with a prenatal diagnosis of absent pulmonary
valve, tricuspid atresia, ventricular septal defect, and congenital heart block. 
Initial treatment consisted of temporary pacemaker implantation, and subsequent
palliation included a central shunt during the neonatal period and placement of a
permanent pacemaker. At seven months of age, a bidirectional Glenn anastomosis
was performed. Cardiac catheterization revealed high cavopulmonary pressures and 
ventricular dysfunction precluding Fontan completion. Heart transplantation was
performed at 3.75 years of age. The patient is alive and well 26 months
posttransplantation.

BACKGROUND: Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare multisystem genetic disorder
characterized by a myriad of abnormalities, including QT prolongation,
syndactyly, and neurologic symptoms. The predominant genetic causes are recurrent
de novo missense mutations in exon 8/8A of the CACNA1C-encoded L-type calcium
channel; however, some cases remain genetically elusive.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic cause of TS in a
patient who did not harbor a CACNA1C mutation in exon 8/A, and was negative for
all other plausible genetic substrates.
METHODS: Diagnostic exome sequencing was used to identify the genetic substrate
responsible for our case of TS. The identified mutation was characterized using
whole-cell patch-clamp technique, and the results of these analyses were modeled 
using a modified Luo-Rudy dynamic model to determine the effects on the cardiac
action potential.
RESULTS: Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel CACNA1C mutation, p.Ile1166Thr, 
in a young male with diagnosed TS. Functional electrophysiologic analysis
identified a novel mechanism of TS-mediated disease, with an overall loss of
current density and a gain-of-function shift in activation, leading to an
increased window current. Modeling studies of this variant predicted prolongation
of the action potential as well as the development of spontaneous early
afterdepolarizations.
CONCLUSION: Through expanded whole exome sequencing, we identified a novel
genetic substrate for TS, p.Ile1166Thr-CACNA1C. Electrophysiologic experiments
combined with modeling studies have identified a novel TS mechanism through
increased window current. Therefore, expanded genetic testing in cases of TS to
the entire CACNA1C coding region, if initial targeted testing is negative, may be
warranted.

[Dilated cardiomyopathy caused by p.E446K mutation in SCN5A gene].

[Article in Russian]

Zakliaz'minskaia EV, Chapurnykh AV, Voronina TS, Van EIu, Shestak AG, Saber S,
Dzemeshkevich SL.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is myocardial disorder characterized by progressive 
heart chambers enlargement and impairment of myocardial contractility. This
disorder is the most common cause of advanced heart failure requiring the heart
transplantation. The prevalence of the disease is 36.5 per 100 000 in population.
About 20-30% of cases are familial. Disease is genetically heterogenous, there
more than 100 genes when mutated can give rise a DCM. In 2004, the role of SCN5A 
gene mutations was shown in origin of DCM with cardiac conduction defects and
arrhythmias. In this work we present a clinical case of dilated cardiomyopathy
with cardiac arrhythmias and p.E446K mutation in SCN5A gene. We have observed DCM
with mild left ventricular hypertrophy, progressive AV block, atrial fibrillation
and congenital heart defect (atrium septal defect) in two generations. The
congenital heart defect did not co-segregate with SCN5A mutation and DCM.

Absent right and persistent left superior vena cava: troubleshooting during a
challenging pacemaker implant: a case report.

BACKGROUND: Venous anomalies of the thorax can occur in isolation or in
association with complex congenital heart disease. The incidence of an absent
right superior vena cava in the setting of a persistent left superior vena cava
is very rare in the general population with only a dozen cases documented in the 
medical literature. Such venous anomalies can make for very challenging
electronic cardiac device implantation. We report our challenging dual chamber
pacemaker implant in a patient with such complex anatomy and focus on our
implantation technique that helped achieve adequate lead positioning.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old Caucasian female with degenerative complete
heart block presented for dual chamber permanent pacemaker implant. Lead
implantation was very challenging due to abnormal and rare vena cava anatomy; a
persistent left superior vena cava drained directly into the coronary sinus and
the right brachiocephalic vein drained directly into the left persistent superior
vena cava as the patient had an absent right superior vena cava . Adequate right 
ventricular lead positioning was achieved following numerous lead-stylet
manipulations and careful looping in the atria to redirect its trajectory to the 
ventricular apex.
CONCLUSION: Abnormal superior vena cava development is uncommon and can lead to
technical challenges when venous access is required during various interventional
procedures. Pre-operative imaging can help identify such challenging anatomy
allowing appropriate operative planning; careful patient selection is warranted
for venography given the risk of contrast nephrotoxicity.

Dalili M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Cardiology,Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research 
Center,Iran University of Medical Sciences,Tehran,Iran.

BACKGROUND: Vascular obstruction is one of the complications of radiofrequency
ablation. Following our previous report on the use of radiofrequency energy for
vascular closure in an animal model in this journal, we herein present the first 
ever in-human report. Patient and method The patient was a 3-year-old boy, who
received a permanent endocardial pacemaker for congenital complete heart block.
He also had a conical patent ductus arteriosus. The ductus was occluded with
radiofrequency energy on the arterial side with no complications.
CONCLUSION: Closure of patent ductus arteriosus and probably other problematic
small vessels could be achieved with radiofrequency energy. Further experience
will elucidate the future scope of this novel technique.

We report a baby girl with an antenatal diagnosis of biventricular non-compaction
and complete heart block detected at 22 weeks' gestation. Postnatal
echocardiography confirmed severe biventricular non-compaction hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, multiple muscular ventricular septal defects, and mild-moderate
pulmonary valve stenosis. Skeletal muscle biopsy confirmed complex 1
mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. An epicardial VVI pacemaker was
implanted on day 3 of life and revised at 7 years of age. She remains stable at 8
years of age following pacing and medical treatment with carvedilol, aspirin,
co-enzyme Q10, and carnitine. This represents the first report of biventricular
non-compaction hypertrophic phenotype in association with congenital complete
heart block and complex 1 mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency in a child.

BACKGROUND: Complete heart block in pregnancy has serious implications
particularly during the period of delivery. This is more so if the delivery is an
operative one as the presence of heart block may produce haemodynamic instability
in the intra operative period. We report a unique case of a pregnant mother with 
complete heart block undergoing hysterostomy, complicated by placenta accreta and
intrauterine death.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 37 year old Malaysian Chinese parturient was admitted at 25 
weeks gestation following a scan which suggested intrauterine death and placenta 
accreta. She was diagnosed to have congenital complete heart block after her
first delivery eight years previously but a pacemaker was never inserted. These
medical conditions make her extremely likely to experience massive bleeding and
haemodynamic instability. Among the measures taken to optimise her
pre-operatively were the insertion of a temporary intravenous pacemaker and
embolization of the uterine arteries to minimize peri-operative blood loss. She
successfully underwent surgery under general anesthesia, which was relatively
uneventful and was discharged well on the fourth post-operative day.
CONCLUSION: Congenital heart block in pregnancies in the presence of potential
massive bleeding is best managed by a team, with meticulous pre-operative
optimization. Suggested strategies would include insertion of a temporary
pacemaker and embolization of the uterine arteries to reduce the risk of the
patient getting into life threatening situations.

Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder with
cardiac rhythm abnormalities that may occur as a child grows. No report has
described complete atrioventricular (AV) block detected in a neonate with CMD. We
report a floppy infant of 31(+4) weeks gestation with complete AV block at birth,
who was diagnosed with CMD by Southern analysis. She recovered from complete AV
block 32 hr after temporary transcutaneous pacing was applied. To the best our
knowledge, this is the first recorded case of a complete AV block accompanied by 
CMD during the neonatal period. When a newborn has a complete AV block, the
physician should consider the possibility of the CMD and conduct a careful
physical examination.

A 17-year-old male patient presented with cyanosis, repeated squatting since
childhood and haemoptysis since the past 1 month. He had central cyanosis with
clubbing. Cardiovasular examination revealed ejection systolic murmur in the
pulmonary area with single S2. ECG showed right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH)
with right atrial enlargement and first-degree heart block. Two-dimensional echo 
showed ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, RVH, right ventricular
enlargement (RVE) and right atrial enlargement with infundibular and valvular
pulmonary stenosis and 1.9 cm ostium secondum atrial septal defect. There was no 
evidence of atrioventricular canal defect. The patient was diagnosed with
pentology of Fallots. Follow-up ECG showed complete heart block (CHB) that again 
reverted to first-degree heart block. A diagnosis of pentology of Fallot with
intermittent CHB was made with an awake heart rate of 50/min. This case report
shows association of CHB with tetralogy of Fallot.

Quadricuspid aortic valve is a rare congenital abnormality often associated with 
valve incompetence and requires surgical correction in adulthood. However, using 
a standard suture technique of aortic valve replacement, postoperative complete
atrioventricular block is not uncommon because of the downward displacement of
the supranumerary leaflet towards the membranous septum. We describe a suture
technique where the sutures on the supranumerary leaflet were passed through the 
aortic sinusal wall above the valvar hinge. This technique can preclude injury to
the conduction system, thereby avoiding atrioventricular block.

Aberrant right coronary artery arising from the left sinus of Valsalva with an
interarterial course.

De Pooter J, Van Driessche L, Bartunek J.

An anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva 
with an interarterial course is a rather rare congenital anomaly. Treatment
strategies are determined by the risk of sudden cardiac death and the presence of
cardiac ischaemia. We present two cases of middle-aged patients who were
diagnosed with an interarterial course of a right coronary artery originating
from the opposite sinus of Valsalva. As no cardiac ischaemia could be documented 
these patients were treated medically with excellent long-term follow-up.

AIMS: Dextrocardia is a rare congenital anomaly. Pacemaker implantation in
dextrocardia can be challenging because of the distorted anatomy and associated
anomalies. The literature regarding implantation of pacemaker in dextrocardia is 
scarce.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study involved retrospective analysis of records of
patients with dextrocardia who had undergone pacemaker implantation between
January 2006 and July 2013 from a single centre. Six patients with dextrocardia
(five males and one female) underwent permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI)
between January 2006 and July 2013. Of them, three had situs solitus dextrocardia
and three situs inversus dextrocardia. All three patients with situs solitus
dextrocardia had associated corrected transposition of great arteries. The
indication for pacemaker implantation was symptomatic complete atrioventricular
(AV) block in four, high-grade AV block in one, and sinus node dysfunction in one
patient. A favourable outcome was noted during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years (4
months to 7 years) with one patient needing a pulse generator replacement.
CONCLUSION: Permanent pacemaker implantation in dextrocardia can be challenging
because of the distorted anatomy. Use of a technique employing angiography to
delineate chamber anatomy and relationship can assist the operator during such
difficult PPIs. The medium- and long-term survival after a successful pacemaker
implantation in dextrocardia is favourable.

leads with left bundle branch block in frontal leads and left axis deviation) is 
seen most commonly with coronary artery disease and hypertension. No definite
explanation is available so far for these changes. We are presenting a case of
rare congenital intranuclear inclusion myopathy with congestive heart failure and
'Masquerading' bundle branch block in ECG.

A persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is a rare and usually unnoticed
congenital anomaly. However, clinicians must be conscious of its existence as a
PLSVC can be associated with other anomalies of cardiovenous morphology with
significant clinical implications for transvenous procedures. We report a case of
a double superior vena cava with absent innominate vein found during
catheterization for cardiac resynchronization pacemaker therapy implantation
(CRT-P). We also describe a technique used for successful positioning of the
leads into the right atrium and right ventricle.

Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital heart disease, accounting for less than 1%
of all congenital heart diseases, characterized by a wide clinical,
electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, anatomic and prognostic polymorphism.
The disease can be fatal since birth or may remain asymptomatic until adulthood, 
sometimes being associated with septal defects, transposition of great vessels,
preexcitation syndromes, or left ventricular noncompaction. The genetic changes
underlying this syndrome are not fully known, but in the cases associating left
ventricular nonompaction a mutation in MYH7 gene encoding the beta-myosin heavy
chain was recently detected. The authors present 2 cases of Ebstein's anomaly
with different onset and course and discuss the current clinical,
electrocardiographic and echocardiographic criteria used for prognostic
stratification of Ebstein disease in relation to international literature.

The optimal anaesthetic management of neonates with complete congenital heart
block (CCHB) is unknown, as there is a low incidence of such cases. Neonates with
CCHB often require surgery for the initiation of electronic pacing. In addition
to the challenges of anaesthetising a neonate, this procedure is risky due to the
potential for hypotension, arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. We herein present the 
case of a premature low-birth-weight neonate with antibody-related CCHB and
normal heart structure who underwent anaesthesia and surgery for epicardial
pacing wire insertion on Day 1 of life. We also compare our patient's anaesthetic
conduct and outcome with similar previously reported cases.

We have previously reported an 18-year-old girl with a congenital heart defect
who developed complete heart block after one of her corrective surgeries and who 
needed an epicardial pacemaker implantation. She developed contact sensitivity to
silicone compounds. The problem was solved by implanting a silicone-free
pacemaker system utilizing silicone-free transvenous leads. The patient was
readmitted 2 years later due to lead failure. As no silicone-free epicardial
leads were available, we decided to use standard silicone epicardial leads and
enclose the whole system in Gore-Tex material (W.L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff,
AZ). Based on our experience we would discourage the use of silicone-free
transvenous pacing leads for epicardial use.

BACKGROUND: Autoantibody-related congenital heart block (CHB) is an autoimmune
condition in which trans placental passage of maternal autoantibodies cause
damage to the developing heart conduction system of the foetus.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of an Italian 31-year-old woman, in a good
clinical status, referred to our Centre at 26 weeks of her first pregnancy,
because of foetal bradycardia, found during routine foetal ultrasonography.
Foetal echocardiography revealed a 3rd degree CHB, without any anatomical
defects. Despite the mother was asymptomatic for autoimmune disease, anti-Ro/La
were searched for, because of the hypothesis of autoantibody-related CHB. High
title of maternal anti-Ro/SSA antibodies was found and diagnosis of an
autoantibody-related CHB was made. A combination treatment protocol of the mother
was started with oral betamethasone, plasmapheresis and IVIG. An emergency
C-section was performed at 32 + 3 weeks of gestation because of a non-reassuring 
cardiotocography pattern. A male newborn (BW 1515 g, NGA, Apgar 8-10) was treated
since birth with high-flow O2 for mild RDS. IVIG administration was started at
one week, and then every two weeks, until complete disappearance of maternal
antibodies from blood. Because of persistent low ventricular rate (<60/min),
seven days following birth, pacemaker implantation was performed. The baby is now
at 40th week with no signs of cardiac failure and free of any medications.
CONCLUSION: Up to date, no guidelines have been published for the treatment of
"in utero-CHB" and only anecdotal reports are available. It has been stated that 
a combination therapy protocol is effective in reversing a 2nd degree CHB, but
not for 3rd degree CHB. In cases of foetal bradycardia, weekly foetal
echocardiographic monitoring needs to be performed and in cases of 2nd degree CHB
and 3rd degree CHB maternal therapy could be suggested, as in our case, to avoid 
foetal heart failure. In cases of 3rd degree CHB often pacemaker implantation is 
needed.

Cor triatriatum dexter (CTD) is an extremely rare cardiac anomaly in which the
right atrium is divided into two distinct chambers by a membrane. The persistence
of the right valve of sinus venosus results in a complete septation of the right 
atrium. This anomaly is frequently associated with other right-sided cardiac
abnormalities. Its clinical manifestation and the need for intervention are
determined by the number and the size of the fenestrations on the membrane,
associated cardiac anomalies and arrhythmias. We describe a case of CTD in a
patient with complete atrioventricular (A-V) block.

Despite advances in device closure for atrial septal defect, post-closure heart
failure remains a clinical problem in adult patients but is seen only rarely in
children. An eight-year-old boy, who had been followed by a local pediatrician
with the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and congenital heart disease, was
consulted to us for cardiac re-evaluation. Electrocardiography demonstrated
absent P waves, and echocardiography revealed enlargement of the right ventricle 
and both atria and secundum atrial septal defect. With the diagnosis of atrial
standstill, secundum atrial septal defect and thiamine-responsive megaloblastic
anemia, acute heart failure developed after transvenous closure of the atrial
septal defect, which improved dramatically with thiamine and supportive
treatment.

Situs inversus with dextrocardia is a congenital condition in which the heart is 
a mirror image of the anatomically normal heart on the right side. A patient
presented with the sick sinus syndrome accompanying mirror image dextrocardia
which was associated with double superior vena cava and a left sided inferior
vena cava A permanent transvenous demand pacemaker was inserted because of
repeated episodes of dizziness and a single episode of syncope with ECG showing
bradycardia with junctional escape rhythm. Precise knowledge of the venous system
and the location of the apex of the right ventricle were necessary prior to
permanent pacemaker implantation. Without such knowledge pacing may be
technically challenging.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus complicated by improved congenital complete heart
block.

Maternal and Child Health, Osaka, Japan.

Complete congenital heart block (CCHB) accompanied with neonatal lupus
erythematosus is caused by an immune reaction between maternal anti-Ro/SSA
antibodies and the fetal heart and is generally considered an irreversible
process. This reaction mostly occurs before 30 weeks' gestation, especially
between the 20th and 24th week. Reported here is an atypical case of neonatal
lupus erythematosus with CCHB detected after 32 weeks' gestation that showed
postnatal improvement in the degree of heart block after preterm delivery and
immunoglobulin use. The clinical condition of the infant worsened with an
increase in heart rate due to possible cardiomyopathy induced by the immune
reaction.

Reported herein is the case of a 2-year-old boy with Adams-Oliver syndrome who
presented with dilated cardiomyopathy and complete atrioventricular block. The
patient had aplasia cutis congenita with partial aplasia of the skull bones, and 
terminal transverse limb malformations characteristic of the disease. Although
congenital cardiac malformations may be associated with the syndrome, dilated
cardiomyopathy has not been previously reported to be associated with the
syndrome.

Development of dilated cardiomyopathy in patients with congenital complete
atrioventricular block with or without pacemaker is well described. We report a
case of dilated cardiomyopathy in a child with congenital complete
atrioventricular block, long-QT syndrome, and VVI pacemaker. Temporary pacing in 
the right ventricular outflow tract demonstrated a 63% increase in cardiac
output. After change to biventricular DDD pacing, left ventricular systolic
function and diastolic dimensions normalised.

QT interval prolongation during ECG evolution in takotsubo cardiomyopathy poses a
threat of torsade de pointes to predisposed patients. Case report of a female

We report the case of a female patient with congenital complete atrioventricular 
block who developed torsade de pointes (TdP) in the course of takotsubo
cardiomyopathy. On the basis of this case, we show that the electrocardiographic 
evolutionary changes with QT interval prolongation (in the course of takotsubo
cardiomyopathy) may be a TdP threatening period in patients with underlying
predispositions. After reviewing the literature, we also present the
electrocardiographic similarities between takotsubo cardiomyopathy and other
acute heart diseases associated with a large amount of stunned myocardium, i.e., 
other stress-related cardiomyopathies (e.g., those associated with subarachnoid
hemorrhage, pheochromocytoma, or severe illnesses) as well as a reperfused
myocardial infarction. QT interval prolongation is a common feature in the
subacute phase of these entities; however, excessive QT prolongation may be a
sign of predisposition to TdP. In such instances, measures should be taken to
monitor cardiac rhythm closely and to prevent or treat TdP appropriately. Taking 
into account the risk of TdP, it is reasonable to consider takotsubo
cardiomyopathy as a potential cause of acquired long QT syndrome.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block can be concomitant with congenital
heart diseases or maternal connective tissue disorders like systemic lupus
erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. Such patients may require implantation of a
permanent pacemaker due to ventricular dysfunction. While many methods of
pacemaker implantation have been tested, one that is optimal for low birth weight
infants remains to be determined. We present a preterm infant with maternal
Sjögren's syndrome with congenital heart block and describe the technique for
implantation of an intrathoracic dual-chamber pacemaker.

[Cardiac resynchronization therapy in a patient with congenitally corrected
transposition of the great arteries and 2:1 atrioventricular block].

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CCTGA) is a rare
congenital heart disease with an atrioventricular and ventriculo-arterial
discordance in which the morphological right ventricle supports the systemic
circulation and the morphological tricuspid valve is the systemic
atrioventricular valve. Heart rhythm disturbances and ventricular dysfunction
related to electromechanical dyssynchrony are common in adult congenital heart
disease patients with a systemic right ventricle. Thus, these patients may
require conventional pacemaker implantation, which in the presence of ventricular
dysfunction and conduction disease may further compromise cardiac performance.
Indeed, cardiac resynchronization therapy may be an effective treatment option
for these patients. We report the case of a patient with CCTGA and moderate
depression of systemic ventricular systolic function who developed a 2:1
atrioventricular block and was treated with cardiac resynchronization therapy.

Burns in the neonatal period are rare and most commonly due to iatrogenic causes.
We report a case of a preterm neonate who sustained a full thickness electrical
burn following the use of a temporary pacing pad. The case was complicated by
significant co-morbidities and the need for cardiac surgery. We describe the
surgical management of the case, using excision and closure in the form of a
W-plasty. We discuss the reasons for this surgical decision and the importance of
managing complex cases such as this on an individual basis.

Long QT syndrome in the infant with 2:1 atrioventricular block is a malignant
form of disease associated with frequent torsade de pointes in some cases. Those 
patients that do not respond to antiarrhythmic therapy are particularly
challenging to manage. Ventricular pacing in this patient population has been
shown to reduce arrhythmic events. We report a case of a newborn with frequent
torsade de pointes requiring defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
with immediate shortening of the QTc interval with ventricular pacing and
subsequent resolution of torsade de pointes.

We present the case of a 43 year-old female with an isolated episode of atypical 
chest pain and an ill-defined cardiac murmur who was coincidentally found to
possess a large serpiginious residual embryonic structure in right atrium.
Multiple modality imaging was required to confirm this to be a rare giant
eustachian valve remnant. The eustachian valve in the fetus directs oxygenated
blood towards the foramen ovale. While absent or very small in adult life it
rarely persists to any significant degree and must be distinguished from other
right atrial shelf anomalies. The true potential of these structures to cause
pathological interference with cardiac function or symptoms is unknown due to
their rarity.

Fetal onset of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a rare manifestation, and
prenatal diagnosis is difficult. This report describes a boy who presented with
both atrioventricular (AV) block and ventricular tachycardia during the antenatal
period. The early postnatal electrocardiogram showed prolongation of the QT
interval and AV block, subsequently leading to a polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia torsade de pointes. This unique feature of congenital LQTS has a poor
outcome, but the boy was successfully treated with beta-blockers and implantation
of an automated cardioverter-defibrillator. The intrauterine manifestation of
fetal AV block and ventricular tachycardia should raise a high suspicion of
congenital LQTS, and the strong association with a malignant clinical course
should warrant special evaluation. The literature on the prenatal diagnosis,
fetal therapy, and neonatal outcome of this condition also are reviewed.

Left ventricular diverticula are congenital anomalies and are not as rare as
previously thought. In adults, cardiac diverticula are generally accidental
findings during imaging modalities, but concomitant disorders might frequently
coexist. The pathophysiology, management, prognosis, and natural history of
cardiac diverticula remain poorly understood and controversial. Definite
diagnosis is often challenging due to similarities in appearance to other more
common anomalies such as aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, endocarditis, cysts, and
hypertrophied trabeculations. We herein report a rare case of an adolescent
presenting with sinus venosus atrial septal defect, partial anomalous venous
connection, and left ventricular diverticula.

Transvenous pacemaker leads may impair tricuspid valve function. Severe tricuspid
regurgitation due to leaflet adhesion to the pacemaker lead has not been reported
in a young adult patient in the literature. Our patient underwent a transvenous
pacemaker implantation for symptoms of bradycardia. An atrial loop was created in
the right atrium for future growth. After 10 years of follow-up, the patient was 
seen with severe tricuspid regurgitation and enlarged right heart structures due 
to migration of the atrial loop of the pacemaker lead into the right ventricle
and adhesion of the lead to the tricuspid valve. Cardiac surgery and epicardial
pacing was the chosen procedure to solve this problem. The venous system and
right heart valves should be carefully observed during the follow-up of children 
who underwent transvenous pacing.

neonates born from mothers with autoimmune diseases. It is characterized by
erythematous annular polycylic skin lesions, slightly scaling with prevalent face
localization, hematologic and liver diseases and only in 2% of cases with
extracutaneous lesions including complete atrioventricular block. The Authors
describe a case of LEN characterized by isolated atrioventricular block at birth 
and endocardial fibroelastosis without skin lesions in a preterm infant female.
She was born from asymptomatic, ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibodies) and ENA

Cystic tumour of the atrioventricular node (CTAVN) is a rare type of cardiac
tumour. We report a case of a previously healthy nine year-old girl, presenting
with syncope caused by complete AV block. Despite intensive treatment, she died
of multiple organ failure after two days. Infectious and congenital AV block were
ruled out. Histology of the conduction system showed that a microscopic CTAVN was
the cause of death. CTAVN is a rare cause of AV block and cardiac arrest, but
should be considered in cases of unexplained death.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited disorder characterized by QT
prolongation and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as torsade de pointes.
The underlying cellular mechanism is prolonged ventricular repolarization caused 
by mutations in genes encoding cardiac ion channels or membrane adaptors. The
disease can be diagnosed at any age and, very rarely, it can be diagnosed
prenatally or in the neonatal period. Isolated noncompaction of the ventricular
myocardium (INCVM) is defined as the presence of prominent ventricular
trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses within the endomyocardium. This 
report describes a newborn baby presenting with polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia whose diagnosis was LQTS and INCVM. Ventricular tachycardia did not
respond to medical treatment, and a transient epicardial pacemaker was inserted
surgically on his 30th day of life for atrioventricular block and bradycardia.
The transient epicardial pacemaker was upgraded to an epicardial intracardiac
defibrillator on his 40th day. The concomitant occurrence of INCVM, LQTS, and
atrioventricular block needs to be evaluated further.

begun shortly after CHB was detected and continued until delivery. The newborns
were also treated with IVIG (1 g/kg) soon after birth and continued fortnightly
until the anti-Ro/La antibody levels became undetectable. In both cases
second-degree AV block reverted to a stable sinus rhythm with a first-degree
atrioventricular (AV) block. Moreover, there was no recurrence of CHB when
therapy was suspended, as confirmed by a 29 month and an eight month follow-up,
respectively.

A 45 years old woman having dysfunctional uterine bleeding was scheduled for
total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy under general
anaesthesia. On pre-operative anaesthesia assessment, she was found to have
junctional rhythm at rate of 44 beats/minute with bigeminies and pre-mature
ventricular contractions on ECG. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed as
having congenital sinus node dysfunction on the basis of 24 hours Holter
monitoring. She was asymptomatic, no prior comorbidity and belonged to functional
class one. General anaesthesia was successfully managed by vigilance, invasive
monitoring, standby transcutaneous and transvenous pacemakers; use of
cardiostable and vagolytic anaesthetic agents like Etomidate, Atracurium and
Pethidine during the procedure and for postoperative pain management.
Transcutaneous external pacing pads were placed just after induction of
anaesthesia, their functional apability was confirmed and was ready for use if
needed. The transcutaneous and transvenous pacemakers were on backup and both
were not required. Patient was successfully managed and was discharged home on
third postoperative day with uneventful hospital course. The elective pacemaker
implantation was therefore not required.

We report a previously healthy 21-year-old man who developed disseminated
varicella zoster infection complicated with encephalitis, acute renal
insufficiency, liver dysfunction, and an apparent pustular skin superinfection
with Staphylococcus aureus. He later developed an extensively destructive
endocarditis affecting a congenital bicuspid aortic valve, accompanied with
leaflet perforation, complete atrio-ventricular (AV) block, and invasion of
vegetation to both left and right atrium; the endocarditis was attributed to the 
same skin pathogen, S. aureus. He underwent radical debridement of the aortic
valve, membranous ventricular septum, and mitral anterior fibrous trigone,
followed by reconstruction of intracardiac defects with 2 autologous pericardial 
patches and aortic valve replacement. After a permanent pacemaker implantation
and 4 weeks of antibiotic treatment, he was discharged after an uneventful
postoperative course.

Congenital complete heart block associated with transplacental passage of
maternal autoantibodies reactive with SSA/Ro and SSB/La is a rare disease with
significant fetal, neonatal, and childhood morbidity and mortality. We present
the case of dichorionic, diamniotic twins (female twin A and male twin B) exposed
to maternal Ro and La autoantibodies with different disease expression. Twin A
(female) had Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular (AV) block
(Wenckebach); twin B (male) had normal sinus rhythm. Both twins had structurally 
normal hearts but demonstrated echocardiographic evidence of endocardial
fibroelastosis (EFE). Following maternal dexamethasone 4 mg once daily, twin A
reverted to sinus rhythm in utero; twin B remained in sinus rhythm throughout
pregnancy. Echocardiograms after delivery demonstrated resolution of EFE in both 
fetuses, and EKGs confirmed sinus rhythm. However, at five months of age, Holter 
monitor demonstrated first degree AV block and intermittent Wenckebach in twin A.
Twin B remains in sinus rhythm. This case is one of only three in the literature 
that describes Mobitz type I second degree atrioventricular block presenting in
fetuses exposed to maternal SSA and SSB autoantibodies and is the first case that
we have seen reported in twins. Importantly, this case also adds to the growing
body of literature describing EFE as a presentation of neonatal lupus with or
without conduction system abnormalities, emphasizes the spectrum of cardiac
conduction abnormalities in neonatal lupus syndrome, and raises interesting
questions about discordant disease expression in twins.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a rare, passively acquired autoimmune
disease, caused by maternal autoantibodies. Characteristic clinical features of
NLE are transient rash and congenital heart block (CHB), but also hematological
abnormalities and hepatobiliary dysfunction may occur. Complications to the
transient dermatitis are rarely described. We describe two patients with NLE and 
cutaneous manifestations. Both patients had involvement of the sun-protected
genital skin and soles. New manifestations of NLE were gastrointestinal bleeding 
in one patient despite normal coagulation parameters, but with mucosal
telangiectatic lesions found on sigmoidoscopy. In addition, one patient developed
painful atrophy after plantar dermatitis on follow-up with need of orthopedic
footwear. CHB was not found. In conclusion, NLE may be complicated with sigmoidal
telangiectasia with rectal bleeding and painful plantar atrophy.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical course and outcome of fetal sinus bradycardia
(SB) due to maternal antibody-induced sinus node dysfunction.
METHODS: We reviewed the maternal, prenatal, and postnatal findings of fetuses
with SB associated with elevated maternal anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies.
RESULTS: Of the 6 cases diagnosed prenatally, 3 had isolated SB persisting after 
birth and had a good prognosis. Three fetuses with SB and severe myocardial
involvement (congenital complete heart block and/or endocardial fibroelastosis)
succumbed in utero in spite of treatment. Postmortem histopathology in 1 fetus
showed inflammatory destruction of the sinus and atrioventricular nodes. SB was
detected incidentally in a 7-year-old girl. She had intermittent heart block with
progressive sinus arrest requiring permanent pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: Fetal SB associated with maternal autoantibodies may persist in
childhood, with a good prognosis in the absence of widespread cardiac
involvement.

Atrioventricular (AV) block is a delay or an interruption in the transmission of 
an impulse from atria to ventricles due to an anatomic or a functional impairment
in the conduction system. Atrioventricular block may be congenital or acquired.
Electrocardiographic screening of asymptomatic school-aged children (median, 12.4
years) in Japan found the prevalence of a third-degree AV block to be 2 per
100,000. We report a case of asymptomatic complete AV block of unknown etiology
in a 13-year-old child who did not require pacemaker placement. The importance of
recognizing an asymptomatic complete AV block in the pediatric population, the
classification and controversies of pacemaker placement, and the complications of
pacemaker placement are discussed.

We report 2 cases of children who developed a complete atrioventricular block
following an infection, varicella without complication initially in the first
case and Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumopathy in the second case, in which a
first-degree congenital heart block was diagnosed on this occasion. In case 1,
the treatment consisted in oral corticosteroids leading to the recovery of sinus 
rhythm; the course was unfavorable in the second case and required a permanent
pacemaker. This cardiac complication of bacterial or viral infection is rare in
children but evolves to permanent conduction disturbance in 1/3 of the cases. It 
is important to detect this disorder, which is feasible simply by a clinical
examination and an electrocardiogram.

Epicardial pacemaker leads placed during childhood are often not removed when
transvenous systems are placed later in life. The risk of complications related
to retained pacemaker leads and generators is not clear but is generally
considered low. We report the case of a 23-year-old pregnant woman who presented 
with left upper quadrant pain at 20 weeks gestation. The patient was born with
{S,L,L} transposition of the great arteries and had high-grade conduction disease
in infancy compelling epicardial pacemaker placement. A standard transvenous
pacemaker was placed at age 9 years, without removal of the epicardial system.
The patient's abdominal pain was attributed to herniation of abdominal contents
through a diaphragmatic defect at the site of the abandoned epicardial pacing
wire. Her pain improved spontaneously but worsened later in pregnancy leading to 
repair of the diaphragmatic hernia via anterolateral thoracotomy at 30 weeks
gestation. The procedure was well tolerated by mother and fetus. At 38 3/7 weeks 
gestation, the patient underwent uneventful delivery by cesarean section for
breech presentation. This case illustrates the importance of multidisciplinary
collaboration in the care of women with congenital heart disease.

Anti-Ro autoantibody is associated with Sjögren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), and neonatal lupus syndrome (i.e., congenital complete heart
block in newborns). Generally, the adult atrioventricular (AV) node is believed
to be relatively resistant to the scarring effects of anti-Ro/anti-La
autoantibodies. However, there have been some reports of adult complete AV block 
in SS and SLE patients. Here, we report a case of complete heart block in primary
SS with anti-Ro autoantibodies, with no other risk factor for the development of 
heart block, and review their etiological association.

We report a case of ventricular perforation by an active-fixation permanent
pacemaker lead in a young woman with congenital heart defect and pacemaker
because of atrioventricular block. The rarity of the case is based not only upon 
the late perforation (as opposed to the more common acute perforations) but also 
on the near-fatal outcome. The patient experienced sharp chest pain and 1 week
later passed out with cardiac arrest.

We present a case of a 31 year-old male patient with a congenital heart disease -
bicuspid aortic valve with secondary aortic valve insufficiency, in whom
recurrent syncope associated with episodes of complete atrioventricular block was
observed. After implantation of a pacemaker syncope did not reccur. Due to risk
of complications with bicuspid aortic valve it was decided that surgical
treatment should be considered in this case.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great vessels (CCTGV) is a rare
congenital heart defect associated with multiple cardiac morphological
abnormalities and conduction defects. Complete atrioventricular (AV) block occurs
in 30% of patients and it may be present at birth or develop later with a rate of
2% per year; moreover, a systemic right ventricle is frequently characterized by 
heart failure in adult life. We used a bifocal cardiac stimulation for a young
woman affected by CCTGV and atrioventricular Mobitz 2 and 2:1 block, considering 
structural, anatomic condition, and the high rate of pacing she underwent.

Implantation of cardiac pacemakers has been practiced for at least five decades
with continuous developments of the hardware. The invention of dual chamber
pacemakers has initiated a debate concerning its superiority over single chamber 
ventricular pacemakers. Throughout the world, surgeons have been using dual
chambered permanent pacemakers with successful follow ups. However, Pakistan has 
not yet taken the advantage of such pacemaker devices till now. We report three
cases that underwent a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implantation for the
first time in children less than 8 kg with successful follow ups.

Atrioventricular (AV) block and endocardial fibroelastosis associated with
dilated cardiomyopathy are the most common clinical manifestations of
anti-Ro/SSA-mediated fetal cardiac disease. Valvar dysfunction has not been a
prominent feature of this disease; however, recent anecdotal cases have suggested
an association between rupture of the AV valve tensor apparatus and maternal
anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. In the present study, we have described the clinical and 
laboratory findings and reviewed the published data for infants of
anti-Ro/SSA-positive pregnancies with AV valve insufficiency due to chordal
rupture from the papillary muscles. The histopathologic features of the papillary
muscle and ventricular free wall and septum biopsy specimens were examined and
compared to the sections of AV leaflets from 6 autopsied fetuses with
anti-Ro/SSA-mediated complete AV block without chordal disruption. Specific
epitopes to the p200 region of Ro52, and Ro60 antibodies were evaluated in cases 
with chordal rupture. Severe AV valve insufficiency was detected prenatally (as
early as 34 weeks of gestation) or postnatally (as late as 182 days) after areas 
of patchy echogenicity were noted in the papillary muscle at 19 to 22 weeks of
gestation. Postnatally, urgent valve surgery was performed in 5 of 6 patients; 1 
of 6 patients died preoperatively. All patients tested positive for Ro52. Valve
leaflet tissue from the autopsy specimens was normal. The ventricular free wall
and septum biopsy specimens from a patient with chordal rupture showed normal
tissue; however, the papillary muscle biopsy specimens demonstrated severe
atrophy with near total replacement of myocytes by fibrosis and dystrophic
calcifications, and negative immunochemistry findings. In conclusion, these
findings have defined an underappreciated complication of fetal antibody-mediated
cardiac inflammation.

A complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) can be a lethal complication when it is 
not treated directly with isoprenaline and pacemaker therapy. The overall
incidence of CAVB varies between 4 to 8 per cent with a mortality OR of 3.2
within 30 days if untreated. Main causes of CAVB are inferior myocardial
infarction, congenital AV node malformation, mitral valve insufficiency and valve
surgery, metabolic disorders and intoxications. The authors describe a case with 
a CAVB due to lithium-clozapine therapy and relapsing multiple sclerosis.

duration. Contrast to adult patients, CRT has been rarely applied for young
patients. We report on a 9-yr-old boy with progressive left ventricular (LV)
dilatation and dysfunction following chronic VVI pacemaker therapy for congenital
complete atrioventricular block associated with maternal anti-SSA/Ro and SSB/La
antibody. His LV dysfunction was improved after epicardially established CRT.

A 32-year-old female patient presented with cardiac failure because of systolic
dysfunction. Five years before, a DDD pacemaker had been implanted because of
complete atrioventricular block. Echocardiographic examination disclosed left
ventricular hypertrabeculation/non-compaction. Because of sinus tachycardia,
ivabradine was started and the patient's left ventricular function returned to
normal within 4 months. Recurrent creatine-kinase elevation and reduced
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide staining on muscle biopsy suggested metabolic
myopathy.

Ventricular resynchronization by implementation of direct his bundle pacing in a 
patient with congenital complete AV block and newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB) is usually due to failure of
AV nodal conduction with preservation of the His Purkinje system, typically
present at birth. While most patients with CCAVB ultimately require pacemaker
therapy to restore physiologic heart rates, recent studies have suggested that
chronic right ventricular (RV) pacing in patients with CCAVB can have detrimental
effects on cardiac structure and function, and may account for a 7-10% incidence 
of congestive heart failure in these patients. Since the His Purkinje system is
preserved in CCAVB, this patient population could be uniquely well served by
direct His bundle pacing (DHBP) which would be expected to restore physiologic
activation of both ventricles. We present a case of a young woman who presented
with RV pacing-induced cardiomyopathy who responded dramatically to DHBP.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) accounts for
less that 1% of cardiac anomalies, and is defined as ventriculoarterial and
atrioventricular (AV) discordance. The double discordant connection allows for
survival with the right ventricle performing as the systemic ventricle, and the
left ventricle as the pulmonary ventricle. We report a case of ccTGA in a
35-year-old male with situs inversus totalis status post repair of a ventricular 
septal defect (VSD) with a residual VSD, severe systemic AV valve regurgitation, 
and coronary artery disease who presented with chest pain. He subsequently
underwent tricuspid valve replacement and VSD repair, followed by percutaneous
coronary revascularization. This case highlights many important issues of adults 
with congenital cardiac disease, as well as the specific surgical management of
anomalies associated with ccTGA. We review the literature and discuss the
management of these complicated patients.

A newborn with congenital complete atrioventricular block, lissencephaly, and
skeletal abnormalities: a case of suspected cytomegalovirus infection.

We present a case of congenital complete atrioventricular block in a preterm
microcephalic male with multiple additional congenital anomalies, including
spinal and rib abnormalities. The heart was structurally normal, and maternal
tests for autoimmune disorders were negative. The brain had an immature
lissencephalic appearance, suggestive of an insult early in gestation. Genetic
testing was normal, virtually excluding chromosomal disorders that are known to
cause lissencephaly. Viral studies were suggestive of cytomegalovirus infection
during early gestation, and we believe that the patient's clinical presentation
was most likely the result of an early cytomegalovirus infection. The finding of 
complete atrioventricular block in a patient with presumed cytomegalovirus
infection would represent a very rare complication. "Isolated" complete
atrioventricular block in a fetus should be considered an incentive for an
extensive work-up in search for a possible etiology, rather than accepted as a
final diagnosis.

Isolated congenital heart block.

Author information:

Ankara, Turkey.

Isolated congenital heart block, frequently seen in mothers who have
connective-tissue disease, can be transmitted to the fetus through transplacental
passage of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies. Even if the antibodies
appear transiently in the fetal circulation, the block is permanent and can
require pacemaker implantation. Complete congenital heart block is seen in 1% to 
5% of neonates born to mothers who carry these autoantibodies. Herein, we report 
the case of a baby-born to a 31-year-old asymptomatic woman-who manifested
congenital heart block in utero, at 30 weeks of gestation. During gestation and
following birth, no further problems were detected. At her last follow-up
appointment, 8 years later, the girl still had no clinical symptoms, and exercise
increased her heart rate despite complete heart block. We report this case for
its unique presentation, and we discuss isolated congenital heart block within
the context of the inadequate literature on its pathogenesis and treatment.

Dexmedetomidine-related atrial standstill and loss of capture in a pediatric
patient after congenital heart surgery.

Shepard SM(1), Tejman-Yarden S, Khanna S, Davis CK, Batra AS.

Author information: 
(1)Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA, USA. sshepard@rchsd.org

OBJECTIVE: Dexmedetomidine (DEX; Precedex) is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
agonist that produces anxiolysis and sleep-like sedation without narcosis or
respiratory depression and has relatively few cardiovascular side effects. Given 
its favorable sedative properties combined with its limited effects on
hemodynamic and respiratory function, it is widely used in pediatric intensive
care and anesthesia settings.
DESIGN: Case report.
SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit.
PATIENT: A three-yr-old girl was admitted after mitral valve replacement for
persistent severe mitral insufficiency. Her prior history was significant for
tetralogy of Fallot which was repaired at nine months of age. A year later the
patient developed mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency and subsequently
underwent mitral and tricuspid valve repair, pulmonary valve replacement, and a
maze procedure (the latter was performed for persistent atrial flutter).
Following that operation she developed sinus node dysfunction and had a permanent
epicardial dual-chamber pacemaker implanted. Due to remaining severe mitral
insufficiency the patient had increasing pulmonary symptoms, necessitating the
most recent surgery to replace her mitral valve.
INTERVENTIONS: On postoperative day two the patient was hemodynamically stable
and weaning off mechanical ventilation. Tracheal extubation was anticipated to
occur within the next 24 hrs. A DEX infusion of 0.6 mcg/kg/hr was initiated. A
pacemaker interrogation performed on postoperative day three, 21 hrs after the
initiation of DEX, revealed unsuccessful atrial capture.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine was subsequently discontinued and 
the patient's pacemaker was reinterrogated. The interrogation findings were
similar to those seen prior to the initiation of DEX.
CONCLUSION: As a result of these findings, caution is warranted in the
administration of DEX to patients with predisposing conduction abnormalities and 
patients who are pacemaker-dependent.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an immune-mediated disease caused by
transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies, primarily anti-Ro (SSA) and
anti-La (SSB). The major clinical manifestations are congenital heart block,
cutaneous lupus lesions, and hematologic problems. Hepatic, pulmonary, and
neurological involvements are rare. We report a 5-day-old male neonate, born to a
clinically asymptomatic mother, presenting with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia,
cutaneous lupus lesions, congenital heart block, and thrombocytopenia. Both the
neonate and his mother had high titers of antinuclear antibodies (1:640), anti-Ro
(SSA), and anti-La (SSB) antibodies. The thrombocytopenia improved with
prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. The skin lupus rashes and bilirubin
resolved 2 months later, and liver enzymes were completely normal by 6 months.

Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation for conduit dysfunction in the right
ventricular outflow tract is a safe and efficient treatment in selected patients.
We report on a patient with stenosis and regurgitation of a homograft in the
right ventricular outflow tract who developed complete atrioventricular block
during percutaneous implantation of a Melody™ valve. This complete
atrioventricular block spontaneously reverted to a stable sinus rhythm after 3
weeks.

BACKGROUND: Congenital heart block affects 2% of all mothers with anti-Ro/La
antibodies, can cause heart failure in utero, and has a 20% mortality rate in the
first 3 years of life. Maternal fluorinated steroids to prevent or reverse
congenital heart block can cause pregnancy complications. Intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been given with maternal steroids to prevent the
recurrence of congenital heart block, although its efficacy is unproven.
CASE: We report the use of IVIG to prevent progression of 2:1 congenital heart
block with intermittent complete heart block. After two maternal infusions of
IVIG (0.4 g/kg) at 31 weeks of gestation, the fetal heart rate reverted to long
periods of sinus rhythm, which was sustained until postnatal life.
CONCLUSION: Our case supports investigating IVIG in the prevention or treatment
of this life-threatening condition.

Pacemaker implantation after pneumonectomy is rare and there have been no
previously reported cases of acquired dextrocardia after implantation. The
authors report the case of a pacemaker implantation in a patient with complete
heart block, impaired left ventricular function, sclerosis of heart valves and
radiation induced vasculopathy resulting in ostial stenosis of the right coronary
artery 30 years after radiochemotherapy in childhood. Acquired dextrocardia after
right pneumonectomy for mucoepidermoid carcinoma made implantation a challenge
due to and poor fluoroscopic visualization of the heart and increased
radio-opacity of the right chest when compared to congenital dextrocardia.

Passively acquired anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are required for congenital heart block
following ovodonation but maternal genes are not.

Brucato A(1), Ramoni V, Penco S, Sala E, Buyon J, Clancy R.

Anti-SSA/Ro antibodies are necessary but not sufficient to provoke
autoimmune-associated congenital heart block (CHB). Genetic factors are likely
contributory. Accordingly, HLA-related candidates and single-nucleotide
polymorphisms in the promoter region of tumor necrosis factor α and codon 10 in
transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) were evaluated in a unique family: the
surrogate mother (anti-SSA/Ro positive), the biologic father, and the
CHB-affected child (product of ovodonation). There was an HLA mismatch between
the affected child and the surrogate mother. However, both the biologic and the
surrogate mothers shared DQ2 and the profibrosing leucine polymorphism at codon
10 of TGFβ. In conclusion, we observed that CHB can develop in a genetically
unrelated child exposed in utero to anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Testing for
anti-SSA/Ro antibodies might be considered in women undergoing artificial
fertilization. It is possible that there is no direct association of maternal
genes beyond a contributory role in generating the autoantibody.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block associated with QT prolongation:
Description of a patient with an unusual outcome.

The association of a complete atrioventricular block with long QT syndrome is
relatively common and carries a high risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) and sudden
death. It is probably due to a downregulation of potassium channel currents (I
(Ks) and I (Kr)) that impairs ventricular repolarization, prolongs the QT
interval and increases susceptibility to TdP, so it must be considered a
channelopathy. This report describes a 6 year-old boy, with a complete
atrioventricular block diagnosed at 5 months of age, who at the age of 1 year
started having episodes of TdP associated with a prolonged QT interval. He was
treated successfully with propranolol and with a pacemaker implant. At age 3 the 
complete atrioventricular block reversed spontaneously to a first degree
atrioventricular block.

An alternative approach for endocardial pacemaker lead implantation in patient
with persistent left superior vena cava.

Author information:

INTRODUCTION: Persistent left superior vena cava represents a congenital vascular
defect of the venous system, which often makes standard 58 cm endocardial lead
placement impossible.
CASE OUTLINE: A right chamber approach by the left cephalic vein was tried. This 
was impossible because standard endocardial lead (SJM Isoflex 5 1646T, bipolar
lead, 58 cm in length, body diameter 7 French) was too short for this patient. A 
unipolar lead for coronary sinus (Medtronic ATTEIN 4193-88), 88 cm in length,
body diameter 4 French, was placed in the posterior branch of the coronary sinus.
With such positioning of the lead, a VVI pacemaker pacing was enabled. The
operation lasted for 48 minutes, and the time of total X-ray exposure was 9.6
minutes. The values that were achieved were: threshold 0.3 V, pulse width 0.37
ms, maximum R 22.55 mV. Ten months after the implantation, the values were:
threshold 0.3 V, maximum R 28.8 mV.
CONCLUSION: Persistent left superior vena cava in some cases makes standard 58 cm
endocardial lead placement impossible due to its joining to the right atrium over
the dilated coronary sinus. Coronary sinus lead placement in the posterior or
lateral coronary sinus branch represents an acceptable alternative approach for
pacemaker lead placement in these patients.

Patients with congenital heart disease and prosthetic valves frequently present
management dilemmas related to cardiac pacing and lead placement. Permanent
pacing of the right ventricle across a bioprosthetic tricuspid valve presents
discreet issues related to its potential for traumatic injury and subsequent
prosthetic valve dysfunction. Coronary sinus (CS) lead placement is being used
more frequently to avoid valvular dysfunction. We report an unusual case in which
the CS ostium was located ventricular to the tricuspid prosthesis. Intracardiac
echocardiography was used to position a CS lead between the commissures of the
tricuspid prosthesis resulting in trivial regurgitation acutely and at 1-year
follow-up.

Author information: 
(1)Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.

The authors present the unique case of an 8-month-old baby diagnosed with severe 
left ventricular failure of unknown etiology. Due to a lack of organ availability
for this age, a mechanical assist device and assessment for cardiac
transplantation were not offered. Subsequent comprehensive echocardiographic
dyssynchrony assessment and the presence of left bundle branch block were
suggestive of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy. Dual-chamber
epicardial pacing was initiated, resulting in prompt marked clinical and
echocardiographic improvement, which continued until complete normalization of
cardiac function. The pacing system was safely turned off 6 months after its
implantation. In conclusion, cardiac resynchronization therapy should be
considered as a treatment option even in infancy, regardless of the etiology of
disease and/or patient age.

The common respiratory syncytial virus has been associated with cardiac
involvement, usually tachyarrhythmias and occasionally myocarditis. A child is
described who probably developed a complete heart block following respiratory
syncytial bronchiolitis. Such an association needs to be considered if the heart 
is structurally normal and there is no evidence of a congenital heart block in a 
setting of maternal anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.

Atrioventricular block after transcatheter ASD closure using the Amplatzer septal
occluder: risk factors and recommendations.

Transcatheter device closure of atrial septal defects is now considered an
alternative option to open heart surgery with good short-term and long-term
results (Du et al., J Am Coll Cardiol 2002;39:1836-1844, Chessa et al., J Am Coll
Cardiol 2002;39:1061-1065); in comparison with surgical closure, the complication
rate is lower (Du et al., J Am Coll Cardiol 2002;39:1836-1844). Arrhythmias are
known infrequent complications of device closure. However, complete heart block
is a rare complication of both treatment modalities (Chessa et al., J Am Coll
Cardiol 2002;39:1061-1065). We report two patients who developed atrioventricular
(AV) block within 48 hr after uncomplicated device closure of ASD using the
Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) device. Despite trials of high dose steroids and 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents in both patients, the response was
inadequate and by the end of the first week, both patients were ultimately sent
for surgical removal of their devices with complete resolution of their
atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. We discuss the possible etiology and
risk factors of AV block and propose recommendations for management of such a
complication.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus: three case reports and review of the Chinese
literature.

Wei Sun(1), Yuan TM, Chen LH, Yu HM.

Author information:

To recognize the clinical characteristics and outcomes of neonatal lupus
erythematosus (NLE), the authors retrospectively review 3 NLE babies in their
department and compared their data with 51 NLE cases reported in the available
Chinese literature between January 1991 and December 2008. Most of the cases were
located near the eastern coast of China, and clinical manifestation of 72.22% of 
the cases occurred in 2-week-old babies. Skin findings occurred in 94.44% of the 
patients, 12.96% with complete heart block (CHB), 22.22% with thrombocytopenia,
and 14.81% with transient elevated transaminase levels. Cutaneous lesions,
thrombocytopenia, and transaminase level showed improvement; 3 CHB cases had
persisted after 7 to 10 years follow-up, and 1 case died in 5 months. Twenty-four
(44.44%) pregnant woman with anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies are
asymptomatic, and antibody status is first indicated when their child shows
symptoms of NLE. Thus, all pregnant women should be screened for anti-Ro/ SSA and
anti-La/SSB antibodies.

We present a case study of a patient with a congenital heart block associated
with a left isomerism that was diagnosed during the 26th week of gestation. The
mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus that was difficult to control during the
early stages of the pregnancy. A fetal echocardiogram revealed an
atrioventricular dissociation, with an atrial rate of 120 bpm and a ventricular
rate of 55 bpm. Subsequent examinations also revealed a left isomerism in the
fetus. To increase the fetal heart rate, a continuous intravenous infusion of
ritodrine was administered. The fetal ventricular rate rapidly increased to 65
bpm. The pregnancy successfully continued until term and a female infant weighing
3,182 g was born via a cesarean section. A subsequent surgery was performed to
provide the infant with a permanent cardiac pacemaker, and notably, the child is

Isolated complete congenital heart block (CHB) in the majority of cases is
associated with the presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens 
in the maternal serum. The prognosis is less favorable in fetuses with a
ventricular rate < 55bpm. We have reported a case of a fetus with an isolated
non-autoimmune CHB with an extremely low ventricular rate (34bpm) in which the
outcome was favorable. In the neonate the non-compaction of the myocardium was
diagnosed.

Pacemaker upgrade causing new-onset heart failure in a patient with complete
congenital atrioventricular block.

For infants with congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB), the choice
of pacing modalities is limited. Due to their size and surgical limitations,
neonates typically start with an epicardial right ventricular pacing system, then
upgrade to right-sided dual-chamber pacing once appropriate size is achieved.
These modes are generally well tolerated. However, the reported case involved a
patient with CCAVB who paradoxically experienced congestive heart failure after
upgrading to a dual-chamber system, a theoretically superior pacing modality.
With conversion to biventricular pacing, a relatively new modality for adults
with very little pediatric experience to date, the patient's symptoms
dramatically improved.

We describe the case of a newborn with isolated noncompaction of the ventricular 
myocardium, congenital atrioventricular block, and prolonged QT, who developed a 
dilated cardiomyopathy after 4 months of right ventricular permanent pacing. The 
implanted system was upgraded to biventricular pacing. Resynchronization therapy 
was associated with normalized septal motion and shortening of the
interventricular delay and, within 2 months after initiation, resulted in
markedly improved left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced ventricular
volume.

We report a case of atrioventricular (AV) block diagnosed 28 years ago
compensated by a functional accessory pathway. During follow-up, the accessory
pathway conduction properties at rest deteriorated while the refractory
properties were unchanged. At 46 years, the patient became symptomatic from
bradycardia and a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted. Although rare, concealed 
AV block due to an accessory pathway has to be recognized before radiofrequency
ablation.

Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions that are a remnant from abnormal
budding of the embryonic foregut. These cysts are usually single; most cases are 
either asymptomatic or present with respiratory symptoms. A 43-year-old woman
presented with intermittent type II atrioventricular block during
cholecystectomy. The cardiac evaluation including transthoracic and
transesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cystic
homogeneous mass within the interatrial septum. The patient underwent surgical
resection of the mass and closure of the septal defect. Histopathology identified
ciliated columnar epithelium, consistent with the diagnosis of a bronchogenic
cyst.

OBJECTIVES: Conventional manifestations of fetal Sjogren's antibodies (SSA/SSB)
associated cardiac disease include atrioventricular block (AVB), transient sinus 
bradycardia, endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) and dilated cardiomyopathy. We
describe other manifestations of cardiac disease.
METHODS: We describe three fetuses with unique myocardial and conduction system
disease.
RESULTS: One had isolated EFE with subsequent mitral and tricuspid valve chordal 
avulsion, the second had sinoatrial and infrahissian conduction system disease,
and in both, neonatal progression to life threatening disease occurred. The third
had sinus node dysfunction and atrial flutter.
CONCLUSION: These findings expand the clinical phenotype of maternal SSA/SSB
antibody associated fetal cardiac disease.

A male child, 18 months old, with interrupted aortic arch, ventricular septal
defect, postoperative complete heart block and an epicardial DDD pacemaker since 
the age of nine months, was admitted to our department because of episodes of
syncope. At first the episodes were considered as epilepsy and the child was
given antiepileptic drugs. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic
monitoring revealed dysfunction of the pacemaker due to exit block in the
ventricular lead, while the atrial lead was functioning properly. The young
patient was treated by preservation of the epicardial atrial lead and
implantation of the ventricular lead via the transvenous route. The ventricular
lead was then connected through a subcutaneous channel to the pulse generator in 
an abdominal pocket.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) can cause both functional and structural cardiac
complications, including a variety of different conduction abnormalities. This is
the first case report of symptomatic diurnal second-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block (Mobitz Type I) in an adolescent with AN. We present a 12-year-old girl
with AN, restrictor sub-type who reported cardiac symptoms during weight gain, at
the time of the initial diagnosis of AV block. Second-degree AV block (Mobitz
Type I) is discussed as a possible complication of the AN, as well as being an
intrinsic conduction system disease.

The missing leak: a case report of a baffle-leak closure using real-time 3D
transoesophageal guidance.

Brady-arrhythmias in patients undergone atrial switch procedures (Mustard or
Senning procedure) for complete transposition of the great arteries (TGA) are
common and often require implantation of permanent pacemakers. It has been shown 
that in patients with palliated congenital cardiac defects with residual
intra-cardiac shunts, permanent pacemaker implantation is associated with an
increased risk of thrombo-embolism. Patients with TGA and concomitant baffle
leaks may have an even further increased thrombo-embolic risk, given that the
leaks can provide the conduit for venous to systemic thrombo-embolism. In order
to decrease this risk, all TGA patients who require pacemaker implantation
typically undergo a thorough pre-procedural evaluation to assess for the presence
of a baffle leak. Traditional imaging modalities, however, are often limited in
their ability to detect and/or properly locate small baffle leaks. We report a
case of a patient with TGA and a baffle leak that was both identified and
percutaneously closed with the assistance of real-time 3D transoesophageal
echocardiography.

Cystic tumor of the atrioventricular node: an unexpected finding in an explanted 
heart.

Sharma G(1), Linden MD, Schultz DS, Inamdar KV.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Henry Ford Health System

SUMMARY: We report herein a unique case of cystic tumor of atrioventricular (AV) 
node (CTAVN), which, to our knowledge, is the first of its kind diagnosed in an
explanted heart specimen and only the fourth diagnosed antemortem. Often, this
rare tumor can only be diagnosed by careful gross examination and adequate
sampling of AV node region. It is an important differential diagnosis in young
patients with syncopal attacks and varying degrees of heart blocks.
CONTEXT: CTAVN is a rare, benign tumor. Most cases have been reported in young
females (mean age, 38 years). Patients typically present with conduction
abnormalities including complete heart block leading to sudden cardiac death.
Most cases have been identified at autopsy; no cases to our knowledge have been
reported in an explanted heart.
DESIGN: A 19 year-old female presented to the cardiac transplant clinic for
evaluation of severe congestive heart failure felt to be secondary to postpartum 
cardiomyopathy. The patient's history was significant for congenital heart block 
requiring placement of a permanent pacemaker at 12 years of age. At the time of
this presentation, electrocardiogram revealed second-degree AV block, and
two-dimensional echocardiogram showed lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial
septum. Seven months later, orthotopic cardiac transplantation was performed.
RESULTS: On gross examination, the explanted heart weighed 500 g and had
biventricular dilatation. Histologic sections of left and right ventricle
revealed myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis consistent with dilated
cardiomyopathy. Sections from the AV node showed a lesion with morphological
features of CTAVN. It was composed of cysts of varying sizes lined by
transitional, cuboidal and squamous epithelium. Some cysts were filled with
proteinaceous debris that were periodic acid Schiff-positive and diastase
resistant.
CONCLUSIONS: CTAVN occurs exclusively in the area of the AV node, tricuspid
valve, and inferior atrial septum. These lesions are now believed to be
endodermal in origin, although mesothelial origin was earlier proposed. We report
herein a case of CTAVN, the first of its kind diagnosed in an explanted heart
specimen and only the fourth diagnosed antemortem.

[Case of west syndrome associated with transient marked sinus dysfunction during

An 11-month-old boy with multiple congenital anomalies developed West syndrome
and ACTH therapy was started. Marked bradycardia during sleep was observed after 
the 16th day of ACTH therapy. Echocardiography revealed both intraventricular
septum and left ventricular free wall thickening with preservation of
biventricular function. Both the patient's marked sinus dysfunction and his
cardiac hypertrophy were suspected to be related to the ACTH therapy. Sinus
function gradually improved after ACTH therapy was withdrawn and treatment with
oral beta-agonist was started. We believe that the patient's sinus dysfunction
and cardiac hypertrophy were caused by ACTH treatment because of the subacute
nature of the onset and the absence of other potentially contributory factors
such as infection or respiratory failure. Pediatricians should be aware that
cardiac dysfunction could be associated with ACTH therapy for West syndrome.

Malpositioning of a pacemaker lead to the left ventricle accompanied by posterior
mitral leaflet injury.

There have been several reports of a malpositioned pacemaker lead as a
complication in pacemaker implantation. Herein we report a rare case of a
malpositioned pacemaker lead in the left ventricle, which could occur in patients
with cardiac structural abnormalities. A 70-year-old woman, who had undergone
implantation of a pacemaker at the left subclavian position for complete
atrioventricular block five years previously, was evaluated because of dyspnea
and low grade fever. Echocardiography revealed a congenital atrial septal defect 
through which the lead was placed into the left ventricle. Whereas percuteneous
lead removal seemed to be full of risk with concerns of thromboembolic events and
infective endocarditis, the patient was referred to our hospital for surgical
removal of the wire and closure of the defect. The lead was a screw-in type and
removed and was extracted in the theatre using radiography. Intraoperatively it
was found that the lead was positioned in the left ventricle apex after
perforating the posterior mitral leaflet. Repair of the mitral valve perforation 
and closure of the septal defect and epicardial pacemaker lead implantation was
performed. This case demonstrated the possibility of malposition of the pacemaker
lead to the left ventricle in a transvenous pacemaker implantation procedure,
which may lead to thromboembolic complication or infective endocarditis, and the 
pre-eminent role of echocardiography in the diagnosis of cardiac structural
abnormalities. A malpositioned pacemaker lead in the left ventricle is a rare
complication that can occur in patients with cardiac structural abnormalities.
Lateral chest roentgenogram and echocardiography is efficient in preventing this 
complication. The removal of the lead in concerns of thromboembolic events and
infection is preferable.

Gerbode type defects are rare left ventricular outflow tract-right atrial
communications in people that may be congenital or acquired; they have been
reported only once previously in dogs. Acquired forms in humans have been
reported secondary to bacterial endocarditis, trauma, and valve replacement
surgery, among other causes. We report a case of left ventricular outflow tract
to right atrium and right ventricle communications (Gerbode type defect) in
association with aortic and tricuspid valve bacterial endocarditis in a geriatric
dog. The dog also developed third degree atrioventricular block and had
underlying subaortic stenosis. The authors hypothesize that the Gerbode type
defect in this case was acquired secondary to invasion and destruction of the
membranous interventricular septum due to bacterial endocarditis.

Progression to late complete atrioventricular block following amplatzer device

Atrial septal defect (ASD) closure by interventional catheterization techniques
has been widely accepted and is considered a standard treatment for this
congenital heart defect. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who presented
with progression of first-degree atrio-ventricular (AV) block to symptomatic,
complete heart block after ASD closure with an Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO).
Although she received steroids immediately after the procedure when second-degree
AV block was seen, her AV conduction slowly deteriorated over 4 years, requiring 
permanent pacemaker implantation. We can only speculate that the injury to the
conduction system was the result of persistent trauma, ischemia, or progressive
scarring caused by the ASO on the AV nodal region. It is uncertain if early
device removal would have prevented this complication. This case highlights the
importance of cardiac rhythm monitoring following ASO implantation for ASD
closure on long-term follow-up.

immunocompetent subjects. This case report is about a rare case of cerebral
abscess caused by Capnocytophaga spp in an immunocompetent subject who had no
risk factors for Capnocytophaga invasive infections (oral alterations, traumatic 
or iatrogenic lesions of pharynx and/or oesophagus, recent dog bite). We also
report Capnocytophaga spp naturally resistant to metronidazole, this being the
cause of inefficacy of this drug usually included in empiric chemotherapy of
cerebral abscess.

Intraoperative dysrhythmias commonly occur in the surgical management of
congenital heart diseases. It may also be seen in other surgical procedures. The 
initiating factors for an arrhythmia during surgery is usually a transient insult
such as hypoxemia, cardiac ischemia, catecholamine excess, electrolyte
abnormality and acidosis. CAVB is a life-threatening dysrhythmia in all ages. We 
herein report a case of transient CAVB in a 30-month-old boy during
living-related liver transplantation for bile duct paucity-associated liver
cirrhosis. Moreover, we discuss the probable etiology and treatment of CAVB in

Extremely low ventricular rate in a fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune
complete congenital heart block. Case report.

Author information:

Padua, Padua, Italy.

Congenital complete heart block (CCHB) is an uncommon disorder with an incidence 
of about 1/20,000 in liveborn infants. It can occur in the setting of
structurally normal heart or with structural disease; it is associated with high 
mortality and morbidity and requires a high index of suspicion for early
diagnosis and therapy. Isolated CCHB in a fetus is usually associated with the
presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens in the maternal
circulation. Such antibodies cross into the fetal circulation and cause
inflammation of the conduction tissues; the causal mechanism is not known.
Although the prognosis for the majority of fetuses is good, it is less favourable
in fetuses with a ventricular rate <55 bpm in early pregnancy or with a decrease 
in the ventricular rate by >5 bpm during pregnancy. It is not known if the same
prognostic criteria apply for fetuses with isolated non-autoimmune CCHB. This
article reports authors' experience in managing a pregnancy with an extremely low
fetal heart rate (47 bpm) in a single fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune CCHB 
in which the outcome was favorable.

Congenital atrioventricular block is a rare, but severe occurrence in the newborn
can be related to various cardiac malformations or to maternal autoimmune
diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus. We report an extremely
low-birth-weight infant affected by congenital heart block, due to positive
anti-RO/SSA and anti-LA/SSB antibodies of the mother, with progressively
increasing respiratory distress syndrome and heart failure. The infant was
successfully treated with an external constant-current, single-chamber
ventricular (VVI) temporary epicardial pacing, placed on the second day of life, 
at the weight of 810 g. After this treatment, cardiac failure resolved and
respiratory assistance could be rapidly stopped. A single-chamber,
rate-responsive, permanent pacemaker was placed at 3 months of life with
steroid-eluting, epicardial-pacing leads. We emphasize that early extrathoracic
temporary epicardial pacing is able to resolve heart failure in an extremely
low-birth-weight infant.

Parvovirus B19 infection in pregnancy is associated with fetal anemia, hydrops
and fetal death. We report two unusual manifestations of vertical parvovirus B19 
infection. The first patient developed hydrops as consequence of myocarditis with
involvement of sino-atrial node. The other had pleural effusion reactive to the
hepatic localization of the virus.

A case of an adult patient with congenital complete heart block is reported in
whom acute heart failure followed pacemaker implantation. It is uncertain whether
the associated cardiomyopathy was present since birth, although right ventricular
pacing was probably responsible for further deterioration of myocardial function.
Synchronous pacing of both ventricles might be recommended in these patients.

We present the case of an infant with a congenital atrioventricular block and
sinus node dysfunction that was implanted with a pacemaker with physiological
closed-loop stimulation (DDD-CLS) pacing mode with two epicardial leads. We have 
observed the response of DDD-CLS system with respect to conventional rate
responsive accelerometer-based mode (DDDR): the atrial pacing percentage and the 
24 h rate trend showed higher values during DDD-CLS compared with DDDR. In this
patient, rate responsive feature seems preserved in DDD-CLS also using epicardial
leads.

Bacterial endocarditis complicating body art.

Tse D, Khan S, Clarke S.

Increasing numbers of patients are living with congenital heart disease at a time
when body art is growing in popularity. We present a case of subacute bacterial
endocarditis following repeated tattooing in a patient with known valvular heart 
disease. This case highlights the importance of education of patients with
structural heart disease to the potential risks of such procedures, particularly 
at a time when endocarditis prophylaxis protocols are being revised.

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of maternal administration of ritodrine in cases of
congenital atrioventricular block (CAVB), especially with fetal heart failure, is
not yet determined.
CASE: At 21 2/7 weeks of gestation, isolated CAVB with a ventricular/atrial rate 
of 55-70/130-140 bpm was found in a fetus from a 30-year-old Japanese nulliparous
woman with anti-SSA antibody. Cardiothoracic area ratio (CTAR) was 40% and no
fetal hydrops was observed. At 30 2/7 weeks, the ventricular rate decreased to 49
bpm with an atrial rate of 125 bpm. CTAR increased to 53.8% and ascites appeared.
Maternal continuous ritodrine infusion was started with rapid improvement of
fetal cardiac function; increment in the ventricular rate to 57 bpm and atrial
rate to 137 bpm, with a decrement in CTAR to 44.6%. Ascites also gradually
decreased and by the fourth day, it had completely disappeared with CTAR of
40.2%. On the 12th day after ritodrine treatment (32 1/7), amniotic fluid volume 
decreased and fetal weight gain stopped, which led us to assume a worsening
intrauterine environment, and cesarean section was performed. A 1,178 g male
infant was born with a 5-min Apgar score of 8. Continuous isoproterenol infusion 
was started, increasing the ventricular rate from 71 to 80 bpm. Pacemaker
implantation is under consideration to treat this infant.
CONCLUSION: Maternal administration of ritodrine not only increased the fetal
heart rate but also ameliorated the signs of fetal heart failure, and thus is
considered one treatment of choice in CAVB.

Epidural anaesthesia during labour for a patient with congenital complete heart
block: a case report.

(1)Department of Anaesthesiology Aga Khan University, Karachi.

We report labour pain management in a full-term pregnant patient with Congenital 
Complete Heart Block. She delivered uneventfully under routine monitoring with
facilities for pacing at hand. She previously had an uneventful normal delivery
and a D&E, both outside our hospital. Only findings were a low heart rate of
45-50 beats per minute. She never had syncopal attacks. She had a good effort
tolerance on ETT. Her ejection fraction was 60% on Echocardiogram. She was given 
a single shot low dose spinal with fentanyl followed by epidural insertion. She
successfully delivered through mid-cavity forceps in about 2.5 hours. The only
problem encountered was a transient bradycardia of 40 per minute with a systolic 
blood pressure of 70 mmHg, which settled with ephedrine. Pace maker insertion is 
recommended early in case the patient is symptomatic or has a prolonged Q-T
interval or left atrial enlargement on ECG. Regional anaesthesia is recommended
to prevent valsalva induced bradycardia or cardiac arrest during expulsive
efforts by the patient.

BACKGROUND: Isolated fetal heart block is considered as an immunological disorder
in the majority of cases. Mothers of affected fetuses often suffer from
connective tissue disease (Sjögren syndrome or Lupus erythematodes). All of them 
test positive for anti-SS-A (anti Ro) and/or anti-SS-B (anti La) antibodies. Once
established, third-degree congenital heart block is permanent and often requires 
a pacemaker.
CASE: We report on a pregnancy in a mother with Sjögren syndrome which was
complicated by the development of incomplete fetal heart block, diagnosed by
pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography. We started oral dexamethasone treatment to 
reduce immune-mediated fetal cardiac damage and to prevent complications like
hydrops fetalis.
CONCLUSION: Detection of isolated fetal heart block is possible with pulsed
Doppler sonography, but there are no clear recommendations for treatment.

heart: sick sinus syndrome, intraventricular conduction block, and monomorphic
ventricular tachycardia.

INTRODUCTION: Rhythm disturbances in children with structurally normal hearts are
usually associated with abnormalities in cardiac ion channels. The phenotypic
expression of these abnormalities ("channelopathies") includes: long and short QT
syndromes, Brugada syndrome, congenital sick sinus syndrome, catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, Lènegre-Lev disease, and/or different
degrees of cardiac conduction disease.
METHODS: The study group consisted of three male patients with sick sinus
syndrome, intraventricular conduction disease, and monomorphic sustained
ventricular tachycardia. Clinical data and results of electrocardiography, Holter
monitoring, electrophysiology, and echocardiography are described.
RESULTS: In all patients, the ECG during sinus rhythm showed right bundle branch 
block and long QT intervals. First-degree AV block was documented in two
subjects, and J point elevation in one. A pacemaker was implanted in all cases
due to symptomatic bradycardia (sick sinus syndrome). Atrial tachyarryhthmias
were observed in two patients. The common characteristic ventricular arrhythmia
was a monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia, inducible with ventricular
stimulation and sensitive to lidocaine. In one patient, radiofrequency catheter
ablation was successfully performed. No structural abnormalities were found in
echocardiography in the study group.
CONCLUSION: Common clinical and ECG features suggest a common pathophysiology in 
this group of patients with congenital severe electrical disease.

Restoration of cardiac function by setting the ventricular pacing at a lower
range in an infant with congenital complete atrioventricular block and dilated
cardiomyopathy.

Chen CA, Chang CI, Wang JK, Lin MT, Chiu SN, Chiu HH, Wu MH.

Patients paced for congenital complete atrioventricular block are at risk of
dilated cardiomyopathy. We report such an infant in whom the dilated
cardiomyopathy resolved after adjusting the ventricular pacing range. The infant 
received an epicardial pacemaker soon after birth for the congenital complete
atrioventricular block. He developed dilated cardiomyopathy 5 months after right 
ventricular pacing at 140 bpm, which is the mean physiological heart rate of the 
newborn and young infant. The cardiac function recovered gradually (left
ventricular ejection fraction from 20% to 74%) after lowering the ventricular
pacing rate to a range from 90 to 120 bpm. We suggest that pacing at heart rates 
that are within the mean physiological range may still be detrimental in young
infants. Adjusting the pacing range may, at least in part, help to restore the
ventricular function.

Comment in
    Cardiovasc Res. 2007 Dec 1;76(3):379-80.

OBJECTIVES: Individual mutations in the SCN5A-encoding cardiac sodium channel
alpha-subunit cause single cardiac arrhythmia disorders, but a few cause multiple
distinct disorders. Here we report a family harboring an SCN5A mutation
(L1821fs/10) causing a truncation of the C-terminus with a marked and complex
biophysical phenotype and a corresponding variable and complex clinical phenotype
with variable penetrance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A 12-year-old male with congenital sick sinus syndrome
(SSS), cardiac conduction disorder (CCD), and recurrent monomorphic ventricular
tachycardia (VT) had mutational analysis that identified a 4 base pair deletion
(TCTG) at position 5464-5467 in exon 28 of SCN5A. The mutation was also present
in six asymptomatic family members only two of which showed mild ECG phenotypes. 
The deletion caused a frame-shift mutation (L1821fs/10) with truncation of the
C-terminus after 10 missense amino acid substitutions. When expressed in HEK-293 
cells for patch-clamp study, the current density of L1821fs/10 was reduced by 90%
compared with WT. In addition, gating kinetic analysis showed a 5-mV positive
shift in activation, a 12-mV negative shift of inactivation and enhanced
intermediate inactivation, all of which would tend to reduce peak and early
sodium current. Late sodium current, however, was increased in the mutated
channels.
CONCLUSIONS: The L1821fs/10 mutation causes the most severe disruption of SCN5A
structure for a naturally occurring mutation that still produces current. It has 
a marked loss-of-function and unique phenotype of SSS, CCD and VT with incomplete
penetrance.

A 46-year-old man presenting with fever, peripheral edema, and chest pain was
admitted to the emergency department. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia 
and first-degree atrioventricular block. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed
infective endocarditis in bicuspid aortic valve, complicated with severe aortic
regurgitation, ring abscess, and sinus-of-Valsalva aneurysm extending to
mitroaortic fibrous continuity. The patient, who was unaware of his bicuspid
aortic valve condition, reported having undergone an orthodontic procedure
complicated with dental abscess 1 month prior, which was treated with combined
clavulanate-amoxicillin antibiotic therapy. Blood cultures were positive for
Bacteroides fragilis resistant to metronidazole. Intravenous antibiotic therapy
was undertaken, with rapid resolution of fever. He eventually underwent
successful aortic homograft implantation and mitral valve repair with residual
first-degree atrioventricular block.

Patients with neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) often have congenital heart
block with or without heart failure and are born to mothers who have anti-SS-A
and/or anti-SS-B antibodies. NLE has been considered to result from the placental
transmission of maternal autoantibodies into the fetal circulation causing
myocardial damage. We report a case of NLE with congenital heart block who had
undergone pacemaker implantation at the age of 17, and then developed dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) at the age of 19, which is much later than in most other
cases. The patient's mother was positive for anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies, 
whereas the patient was negative for both anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies.
There were some autoantibodies against cell surface antigens of cardiac myocytes 
in the serum from the patient, and annexin A6 was identified as one of the
autoantigens. This is the first report demonstrating that annexin A6 is involved 
in the myocardial injury in patients with NLE. The results indicate that
inhibition of annexin A6 function may prevent autoantibody-mediated myocardial
injury in at least some cases of DCM.

An infant with a congenital auriculoventricular block (CAVB) of immunological
origin was diagnosed prenatally. The mother had Gougerot-Sjögren disease with
positive anti-Sjogren's Syndrome A (SSA) and Sjogren's Syndrome B (SSB)
serologies. Cardiac pacing was necessary and the epicardial route was chosen.
Considering the left ventricular (LV) dilatation, bi-ventricular (BiV)
stimulation was preferred to the usual DDD mode, presumed to have a deleterious
long-term effect. Echographic parameters were better with BiV stimulation: the
asynchronism induced by mono-RV stimulation was corrected and the QRS complexes
were narrower. BiV pacing of a CAVB with LV dilation looks clinically and
echographically attractive but needs to be validated in the long term.

The most typical manifestation of cardiac involvement in Lyme disease (LD) is a
high grade and usually fluctuating heart block, which is generally reversible,
even self-limiting. Two cases of LD with a different course of complete heart
block (CHB) are described. In a 43-year-old man admitted due to episodes of
syncope, the diagnosis of LD was delayed -- after pacemaker implantation -- when 
he developed joint and neurological symptoms. Following ceftriaxone treatment
atrioventricular conduction returned to normal. In the second case of a
26-year-old woman, presenting on admission with fatigue and flu-like symptoms,
ECG showed CHB with a stable escape rhythm of about 52/min. Unlike the first
case, she could recall neither a tick bite nor skin rash, but epidemiological
history and serologic test results were indicative of LD. In this case,
antibiotic therapy did not influence atrioventricular block, which was well
tolerated. This suggested the coexistence of borreliosis and previously
unrecognised congenital CHB.

This report presents the case of an infant who was born with transient complete
heart block. The cardiac rhythm converted to normal sinus rhythm within 12 hours 
of life. Following the diagnosis in this infant of congenital heart block, both
the mother and the infant were tested for autoantibodies. Both were found to be
strongly positive for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies. The infant was also weakly positive
for the anti-La/SSB antibodies and her mother moderately positive for the same.
Congenital heart block associated with these maternal antibodies is well
documented in the literature; however, this is the only reported case that
documents a transient nature of the complete heart block.

Good performance was observed over 10 years after implantation of bipolar
epicardial atrial pacing using an active fixation bipolar endocardial lead in 3
pediatric patients with congenital heart block. The bipolar endocardial lead
which was supposed to be fixed transvenously was implanted on the atrial surface 
by first screwing the lead's helix into the myocardium. The catheter was then
laid down on the atrial surface, and both electrodes were wrapped by the atrial
tissue. The good performance of this pacing lead seemed to depend on stable
positioning of the electrode. This lead is superior to the commercially
available, and steroid eluting epicardial bipolar pacing lead, on the point of
its small size in head and body, and could be applied to dual chamber pacing in
smaller children.

OBJECTIVES: Complete heart block has not been reported in association with left
ventricular hypertrabeculation (LVHT)/noncompaction, nail-patella syndrome (NPS),
and mitochondrial myopathy (MMP).
CASE REPORT: A 47-year-old man with congenital NPS from a 17-bp deletion in exon 
5 of the LMX1B gene, MMP from the A3243G mitochondrial DNA transition, and LVHT
was acutely admitted after a syncope followed by dizziness. Cardiological
examinations revealed bradycardia. Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg. Blood work
revealed a creatine kinase of 389 U/L (normal, <175 U/L), renal insufficiency,
anemia, and reduced calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. Electrocardiogram showed 
complete heart block with an escape rhythm of 30/min. A temporary pacemaker was
inserted. During the procedure, the patient became asystole but was successfully 
resuscitated. One day later, he received a permanent pacemaker. Echocardiography 
showed normal systolic function and LVHT. The patient recovered without sequelae.
CONCLUSION: In single cases, LVHT may be associated with complete heart block.
Most likely, complete heart block was due to MMP. Patients with NPS and MMP
require multidisciplinary surveillance, including regular electrocardiograms, for
indicating anticipatory intervention in time.

resulting from an arrest in normal endomyocardial embryogenesis. This disease is 
characterized by numerous and prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular
recesses. It may be isolated or associated with other congenital heart diseases. 
The disorder is clinically accompanied by depressed ventricular function,
systemic embolization and arrhythmias. Sustained bradycardia is infrequent in
prenatal life and associated with maternal collagen vascular diseases, structural
heart diseases or long QT syndrome. Herein we report a case of isolated
noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium diagnosed in the first day of life
and followed previously by serial fetal echocardiograms for the sustained sinus
bradycardia. On postnatal electrocardiography, there was junctional escape rhythm
due to profound sinus bradycardia, leading us to consider sick sinus syndrome. To
our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of isolated noncompaction
of left ventricular myocardium with sustained bradycardia due to sick sinus
syndrome.

A tangled affair: pacemaker malfunction and syncope in a child due to Twiddler's 
syndrome.

South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA. ellisa@musc.edu

Manipulation of an implanted pacemaker by the patient is a rare cause of
malfunction, especially in children. We describe a child who inadvertently
rotated his pacemaker under the skin, knotting the leads and dislodging them from
the heart, leading to syncope and heart block. Our experience with this case
underscores the need to consider this diagnosis in children as well as in adults 
if this problem is to be averted.

[Idiopathyc progressive disorder of atrioventricular conductivity].

[Article in Russian]

Giliarov MIu, Syrkin AL, Zaĭkina AA.

Atrioventricular (AV) blockades are classified into congenital and acquired ones.
Conductive system fibrosis or sclerosis and coronary heart disease are the most
frequent reasons for disturbances in AV conductivity. Congenital AV conductivity 
disorder may be associated with an isolated lesion of the AV conductive system or
with other congenital diseases of the heart. The author describes a case of AV
conductivity disorder which has been progressing for many years.

Electrocautery-induced asystole in a scoliosis patient with a pacemaker.

Bales JG(1), Colon J, Ramadhyani U, LeDoux E, Bennett JT.

Pediatric heart condition management may include a variety of implanted cardiac
devices. Monopolar electrocautery (Bovie) produces significant electromagnetic
interference to these devices. This interference can alter the function of a
cardiac generator resulting in a variety of complications including impaired
cardiac output and asystole. We report the case of a 16 plus 2-year-old girl who 
presented with idiopathic scoliosis and a past medical history significant for
complete congenital heart block treated with a DDD*** pacemaker. During surgery, 
the use monopolar electrocautery caused the patient to develop asystole and loss 
of pulsatile blood pressure. Electrocautery was subsequently terminated, the
patient then returned to a normal sinus rhythm and blood pressure normalized.

Situs inversus with dextrocardia is a congenital condition in which the heart is 
a mirror image of the anatomically normal heart on the right side. Patients with 
this condition are increasingly surviving into adulthood and may present with
heart failure. Several of such patients may benefit from atriobiventricular
pacing which may be technically challenging. This case report describes
techniques and equipment used to successfully place a coronary sinus lead in a
patient with this congenital condition.

We report a case of severe acute cellular rejection of the cardiac allograft
conduction system in a 15-month-old girl who received orthotopic heart
transplantation (OHT) for congestive heart failure from a congenital heart block.
Post-operatively, the patient was treated for clinical evidence of rejection, but
did not have electrocardiographic findings of heart block. Six weeks after
transplantation, the patient developed sudden-onset bradycardia and died. Autopsy
showed severe acute cellular rejection involving primarily the conduction system.
Cellular rejection of the cardiac conduction system is a potentially lethal
complication of OHT. Although diagnostic modalities to predict or detect ongoing 
cellular rejection in the conduction system are limited, recognizing the early
signs, such as post-operative heart block, may prevent devastating consequences.

A quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a rare congenital heart defect, previously
described as an incidental finding at the time of surgery or postmortem, which is
now being increasingly detected by 2D transthoracic or transesophageal
echocardiogram. With advances in echocardiography, secondary cardiac anomalies
are also being described in association with QAV. Herein we describe a patient
with QAV with a secundum atrial septal defect.

Left ventricular epicardial VVI pacing for a congenital complete heart block with
severe myocardial dysfunction: shall epicardial pacing wires be positioned left?

Tissot C, Aggoun Y, Rimensberger PC, Sierra J, Kalangos A, Beghetti M, da Cruz E.

We present the case of a patient with a congenital complete heart block (CHB) who
developed a severe dilated hypokinetic cardiomyopathy whilst paced with a
right-sided epicardial wire inserted by an anterior approach. She dramatically
and rapidly improved both clinically and echocardiographically, once a single
pacing wire was inserted on the left ventricular (LV) wall towards the apex by
left thoracotomy. Based upon recent literature, attention is drawn to the fact
that left-inserted epicardial pacing wires should probably be considered for
pediatric patients in whom atrio-ventricular or inter-ventricular pacing might
not be possible to achieve, or else as a consistent approach for small patients
requiring VVI epicardial pacing.

Waldenström's hypergammaglobulinemic purpura (HGP) is a rare chronic disorder
characterized by recurrent purpura on the legs, a polyclonal increase in serum
gamma-globulin, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a positive
rheumatoid factor. A 30-year-old primigravid woman with 14 years of HGP was found
to have fetal bradycardia at 25 weeks' gestation. Laboratory investigations
demonstrated positive anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in the maternal
serum. Cesarean delivery was performed at 39 weeks, and a 2750-g female infant
was born with complete atrioventricular block. Fortunately, the neonatal period
has been uneventful without need for pace-making. Maternal HGP exacerbated just
after delivery, but resolved within 1 week without treatment. Physicians should
be aware of the possible presence of neonatal lupus-related anti-Ro/SSA and
anti-La/SSB autoantibodies in patients with HGP. Screening for these
autoantibodies is important and could be used as a marker to identify and manage 
high-risk pregnancies.

The incidence of congenital complete heart block is estimated in 1 of 2500-20,000
births. Many cases are isolated (found in an otherwise normal heart) and the
pathology of the heart conduction system is variable. We report a 51-year-old man
with the diagnosis of complete heart block, with a permanent pacemaker. No family
history of rhythm disturbances was available. The patient presented and
endocarditis after replacement of the pacemaker battery. The prognosis was poor
and the patient died three months later. Autopsy examination showed signs of
shock, of septic origin. The heart was hypertrophic (450g) and the left ventricle
thickened. Histopathological examination of the heart conduction system showed
that the sinus and atrioventricular nodes were normal, but the His bundle was
interrupted and replaced by fibrous tissue. No inflammatory signs were present.
Loss of conducting fibres and their replacement by fibrous tissue is the most
common pathological process in complete heart block. In this case His bundle was 
mostly affected, different to Lev's disease where the process is more distal
(branching atrioventricular bundle) and to Lenegre's disease, which shows a
diffuse damage in the conducting system.

Hydrops fetalis due to congenital complete heart block (CCHB) is a rare
condition. The outcome of the preterm fetus with hydrops fetalis due to CCHB is
poor, and is frequently associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The 
management of this condition is difficult. We report our experience in a hydropic
preterm using staged pacing by applying left ventricular epicardial pacing with a
temporary pacemaker and subsequently, left ventricular epicardial pacing with a
permanent pacemaker.

A 1.8-year-old male required a conventional DDD pacemaker for an atrioventricular
block after congenital heart surgery. Five years later, heart failure due to left
ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony progressed and we performed cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT). Long-term echocardiographic follow-up showed
that LV shortening fraction had improved within the first year after CRT, and LV 
end diastolic dimension had decreased after the first year. During LV remodeling 
(1-24 months after CRT), the QRS duration shortened without a change in the JT
and T (peak-end) interval. The New York Heart Association class improved from III
to I during the 2.3-year follow-up.

Quadricuspid aortic valves are rarely encountered by the cardiac surgeon during
aortic valve replacement. The most common location for the supranumerary cusp is 
between the noncoronary and the right coronary cusp, located over the membranous 
septum, which can potentially increase the risk of complete heart block after
valve replacement. We present three quadricuspid aortic valve replacements, one
of which was complicated by complete heart block postoperatively. We suggest a
strategy to possibly avoid this complication.

Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.

In the past, patients requiring permanent pacing with difficult right ventricular
(RV) access were usually subjected to epicardial pacing by a surgical approach.
This report describes a young patient with univentricular physiology following
repeated palliative surgery for complex congenital heart disease. The patient had
symptomatic complete heart block and a dual chamber pacemaker with transvenous
atrial and ventricular leads was implanted successfully. The ventricle was paced 
through the posterolateral cardiac vein with a lead specially designed for
cardiac resynchronization therapy. This case illustrates an extended application 
of the recently developed coronary sinus lead in selected patients, when
conventional RV endocardial pacing is impossible.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is the main complication of neonatal lupus (NL) and 
is strongly associated with the presence of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La
antibodies. The recurrence of CHB in subsequent pregnancies in mothers with these
antibodies is uncommon, occurring in approximately 15% of cases. We describe here
a case of recurrent CHB in a previously asymptomatic mother with Sjögren syndrome
and discuss the current strategies for the prevention and treatment of CHB in NL.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a rare syndrome of newborns and infants
defined by the presence of maternal autoantibodies and the characteristic
clinical features of the infant. The clinical findings most often reported are
congenital heart block and cutaneous lesions; however, many children have
cardiomyopathy, hepatobiliary disease, and/or hematologic diatheses. We present
the case of a 1-day-old African American boy who presented with an annular,
ulcerated facial eruption at birth and went on to develop subacute cutaneous LE
(SCLE) and heart block.

Three patients with heart failure after chronic right ventricular apical pacing
were treated with resynchronization. Biventricular pacing was used for two
patients, and the other was treated with left univentricular pacing. In all
patients, we observed a dramatic improvement of left ventricular dimension,
function, and clinical state. We conclude that biventricular or left ventricular 
pacing is superior to right ventricular apical pacing in children who are
pacemaker-dependent.

The congenital heart block (CHB), diagnosed in structurally normal hearts, is
strongly associated with, if not caused by, maternal SSA/SSB antibodies (Abs). It
develops between 16 and 24 weeks' gestation, coincidentally with the increased
transplacental IgG passage, and a window of unique cardiac vulnerability. Less is
known about rare CHB cases in which neither cardiac malformations nor SSA/SSB Abs
are detectable. We report on four pregnant women: patient 1 at high CHB risk
(owing to Sjögren's syndrome (SS) and recurrent pregnancy losses), and patients
2-4 with already established CHB (aggravated by hydrops in patient 2). Abs were
found directed to SSA/SSB (patients 1-3) or to an HsEg5-like autoantigen instead 
(patient 4). During preventive immunoadsorption (IA) from week 19 throughout
(patient 1), or therapeutic IA (plus dexamethasone), commenced at week 25
(patient 2), SSA Ab levels decreased per session by 47+/-7 or 80+/-16%,
respectively, and hydropic changes resolved. Patient 1 delivered a healthy boy,
while patients 2-4 gave birth to CHB-affected children at need for permanent
pacing. The irreversibility of complete CHB may justify (a) early ANA screening
in all pregnancies (thereby also considering specificities as anti-HsEg5), and
(b) preventive immmunoadsorption in high-risk pregnancies (before/during the
critical cardiac development phase). This implies controversy, because factors
converting risk to disease (in only approximately 2%) are unknown, and
prospective randomized treatment studies are not available, given the rarity of
CHB.

Atrioventricular block has been described in association with cases of long QT
syndrome and mortality is increased in this subgroup. We describe an infant with 
congenital QT prolongation and atrioventricular block with normal cardiac
function, leading to the initial diagnosis of long QT syndrome. She subsequently 
developed dilated cardiomyopathy requiring cardiac transplantation. We postulate 
that the presenting electrocardiograph abnormalities were early manifestations of
the myocardial disease, preceding the development of myocardial dysfunction by
several months. The need for heightened surveillance in cases of QT prolongation 
with atrioventricular block is amplified by the possibility of an evolving
cardiomyopathy.

[Pacemaker lead implant via the persistent left superior vena cava].

[Article in Spanish]

Rodríguez-Fernández JA(1), Almazán-Soo A.

Author information:

BACKGROUND: Persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) is a structural,
asymptomatic and infrequent anomaly, present in 0.5% of the general population.
Typically the diagnosis reveals itself unexpectedly at the time of pacemaker
implantation, when it acquires anatomic relevancy. Several techniques are used
for the transvenous approach to enter the central venous circulation; the left
subclavian vein has become a common access site for electrode implantation and,
occasionally, one can find an anomalous venous structure such as a PLSVC.
Placement of electrodes through this anomalous venous structure can prove
challenging, if not impossible. The present report tries to explore aspects of
transimplantation diagnosis from a practical point of view. It also address the
knowledge of anatomy, implant technique and radiographic orientation.
CASE PRESENTATION: Twenty-six-year-old woman with confirmed Symptomatic Sick
Sinus Syndrome variety Sinus Arrest. The diagnosis of PLSVC was discovered
unexpectedly at the time of the transvenous approach. The tip for the diagnosis
was the "unusually medial" position of the lead, and the venogram showed the
venous traject towards the coronary sinus and drainage into the right atrium. An 
active-fixation screw-in electrode was positioned in the antero-superior margin
of the free wall of the right atrium. After 24 months of successful placement of 
the pacemaker, the patient is asymptomatic.
DISCUSSION: PLSVC is a rare congenital vascular abnormality. Besides its
association with congenital anomalies, its most relevant clinical implication is 
the association with disturbances of cardiac rhythm, impulse formation and
conduction. The ontogenetic development of the sinus node, the atrioventricular
node, and the His bundle might be heavily influenced by the lack of regression of
the left cardinal vein. When isolated, the PLSVC is usually not recognized until 
left superior approach to the heart is required, when it becomes a relevant
anatomic finding. In fact, it can complicate the positioning of left-sided
pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator leads. In patients with poor handling
through the coronary sinus, a right approach is recommended after visualization
of a right superior vena cava entering the right atrium by echocardiography or
contrast venography since its absence or hypoplasia (which is reported in 10% of 
the cases with PLSVC) may represent a major obstacle and would suggest an
epicardial implantation.
CONCLUSION: Today, the preferred approach for pacemaker lead implantation is via 
the left subclavian vein and the operator must be aware of this venous anomaly
that may technically complicate the electrode positioning. This kowledge may be
useful for other medical specialties that require the implant of left sided
transvenous subclavian catheters, like in critical care settings, nephrology,
onco-hematology, and anesthesiology.

Left axis deviation is one of the most commonly encountered ECG abnormalities.
Its presence should alert medical directors and underwriters to the possibility
of underlying structural heart disease. Many of the causes of left axis deviation
are apparent from the clinical findings. Left anterior fascicular block is one of
the commonest causes of left axis deviation and has specific ECG criteria for its
diagnosis.

Prevalence of congenital heart disease increases with nuchal translucency (NT)
thickness. First-trimester fetal bradycardia may result from heart block
associated with complex congenital heart disease. We report two cases detected in
the first trimester of pregnancy, in which both fetuses showed an increased
nuchal translucency and bradycardia. Fetal karyotype was normal in both fetuses. 
First-trimester fetal echocardiography was performed and, in both cases, complex 
congenital heart disease was diagnosed. We discuss the added role of fetal heart 
rate in first-trimester ultrasound screening, in fetuses with increased nuchal
translucency and normal karyotype. We stress, as well, the importance of
echocardiography performed in the first trimester as a potential tool for early
diagnosis in selected cases.

We report a very low birthweight infant with congenital complete atrioventricular
block (CCAVB) who underwent delayed implantation of a permanent pacemaker without
temporary pacing. The female infant was born at 30 weeks gestation and weighed
1422 g. After birth, the infant showed respiratory failure due to pleural
effusion and respiratory distress syndrome at birth. The heart rate ranged
between 50 and 55 bpm. The chest x-ray demonstrated dilated heart, but
echocardiogram showed good systolic ventricular function. Respiratory failure was
resolved after supportive treatment without temporary pacing. Mild heart failure 
due to low heart rate persisted, but was successfully managed by conventional
heart failure therapy combined with nasal continuous positive airway pressure.
She achieved a body weight gain to 1856 g at the age of 49 days and underwent
implantation of a permanent pacemaker. We conclude that it is important to
determine the timing of both delivery and pacemaker implantation for successful
perinatal management of infants with CCAVB.

Successful preventive treatment of congenital heart block during pregnancy in a
woman with systemic lupus erythematosus and anti-Sjögren's syndrome A/Ro
antibody.

Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Tao-yuan County, Taiwan.

Congenital heart block (CHB) that is a manifestation of neonatal lupus syndrome
(NLS) carries a poor prognosis. The treatment response of established heart block
in NLS is usually unsatisfactory. Preventive treatment during pregnancy, however,
before the critical period of cardiac development, can prevent the development of
CHB. A Taiwanese woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was positive for
anti-Sjögren's syndrome A (SSA)/Ro antibody. Her first pregnancy resulted in
intra-uterine fetal death. Her second pregnancy resulted in CHB, despite
dexamethasone treatment, and neonatal death at age 1 day despite pacemaker
implantation. During her third pregnancy, dexamethasone was given starting at
week 10, azathioprine at week 18, and plasmapheresis was performed every other
day for 5 times starting at week 20 of gestation. Cesarean section was performed 
due to oligohydramnion at week 31 of gestation and a healthy girl was delivered. 
This case suggests that judicious use of fluorinated glucocorticoids,
immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis may prevent development of CHB in pregnant
women with SLE who are anti-SSA/Ro antibody positive and have previous children
with CHB.

A patient who had been previously diagnosed with congenital complete
atrioventricular block (CCAVB) twenty years ago developed atrioventricular (AV)
conduction through an accessory pathway (AP). With enhanced sympathetic tone
(exercise, isoproterenol), 1:1 conduction down the AP occurred. An
electrophysiologic study confirmed a suprahissian AV block and the presence of an
AP. The AP was located on the left side and posterior. The absence of retrograde 
conduction through the AP and also a long conduction time were demonstrated.

Reversal of fenestration flow during ventricular systole in Fontan patients in
junctional or ventricular paced rhythm.

Author information:

Hospital of Illinois, 420 NE Glen Oak Avenue, Suite 304, Peoria, IL 61603, USA.

Sinus node dysfunction is relatively common in patients with Fontan palliation
for single ventricle congenital heart disease, and such patients often are in
junctional rhythm or may have pacemaker systems for bradycardia. Because the
physiologic determinants of left atrial pressure play a major role in determining
pulmonary blood flow and therefore cardiac output in Fontan patients, the loss of
atrioventricular (AV) synchrony in junctional rhythm or demand ventricular pacing
in these patients might be expected to influence cardiac output. We report two
cases of Fontan patients with the absence of AV synchrony that resulted in
reversal of flow through the Fontan fenestration during ventricular systole. In
both cases, restoration of AV synchrony by atrial pacing resulted in the
elimination of retrograde fenestration flow, increased cardiac output, and
improved clinical status.

BACKGROUND: Since it's recognition in 1981, a more complete phenotype of Kabuki
syndrome is becoming evident as additional cases are identified. Congenital heart
defects and a number of visceral abnormalities have been added to the typical
dysmorphic features originally described.
CASE REPORT: In this report we describe the clinical course of a child diagnosed 
with Kabuki syndrome based on characteristic clinical, radiological and
morphologic features who died of a cardiac arrhythmia at 11-months of age. This
infant, however, had abnormal pulmonary architecture and alterations in his
cardiac conduction system resulting in episodes of bradycardia and asystole. This
child also had an immunological phenotype consistent with common variable
immunodeficiency. His clinical course consisted of numerous hospitalizations for 
recurrent bacterial infections and congenital hypogammaglobulinemia characterized
by low serum IgG and IgA but normal IgM levels, and decreased antibody levels to 
immunizations. T-, B- and NK lymphocyte subpopulations and T-cell function
studies were normal.
CONCLUSION: This child may represent a more severe phenotype of Kabuki syndrome. 
Recurrent infections in a child should prompt a thorough immunological
evaluation. Additionally, electrophysiology testing may be indicated if
cardiopulmonary events occur which are not explained by anatomic defects.

We identified a family with 10 affected members in four generations suffering
from adult-onset progressive sinoatrial and atrioventricular conduction disease, 
sudden death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and a
unique type of brachydactyly with mild hand involvement (short distal, middle,
proximal phalanges and clinodactyly) and more severe foot involvement (short
distal, proximal phalanges and metatarsal bones, short or absent middle
phalanges, terminal symphalangism, duplication of the bases of the second
metatarsals, extra ossicles, and syndactyly). The phenotype differences from
other reported genetic abnormalities and linkage exclusion of Holt-Oram syndrome,
ulnar-mammary syndrome, brachydactyly type B or Robinow syndrome, and cardiac
conduction disease or Brugada syndrome loci suggest that we report on a new
hereditary heart-hand syndrome.

A four-year-old boy on Valproate therapy for a presumed diagnosis of epilepsy
presented with a recurrence of tonic spasms. A history of precipitation of these 
episodes with exercise prompted a search for an underlying cardiac disorder. The 
child was ultimately diagnosed to have corrected transposition of great arteries 
with 2:1 atrioventricular block. This case illustrates that cardiac syncope due
to underlying congenital heart disease can masquerade as epilepsy in children.

Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction may be dynamic, most commonly
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and, uncommonly, by congenital
anomalies such as discrete subaortic stenosis. We describe a patient with
Behçet's disease, presenting with a systolic murmur, fever, and syncope, in whom 
a diagnosis of subaortic obstruction caused by a pseudo-aneurysm dissecting the
interventricular septum and associated with a complete atrioventricular block was
made.

We report here a boy with epilepsy and congenital heart defect, complicated
postoperatively by complete atrioventricular (A-V) block caused by an adverse
effect of carbamazepine (CBZ). He had been taking CBZ for 7 years to treat
complex partial seizures. He also had endocardial cushion defect and first-degree
A-V block, and underwent cardiac surgery at the age of 17 years. The
postoperative course was unremarkable except transient complete left bundle
branch block occuring one day after the surgery. Oral CBZ (400 mg per day) was
continued. Five days after the surgery, bradycardia (20 beats per minute)
suddenly developed, and electrocardiography (ECG) showed complete A-V block.
Pervenous pacing was begun, and the heart rate gradually recovered. CBZ was
discontinued on the suspicion that it caused the arrhythmia, although its serum
level was estimated to be within the therapeutic range (4 to 5 microg/ml). He
underwent pervenous pacing for 12 days. He was discharged 27 days after the
surgery, when ECG returned to first-degree A-V block. In this case, the cardiac
conduction system was affected by an adverse effect of CBZ, in combination with
the preoperative first-degree A-V block and the effects of cardiac surgery,
resulting in complete A-V block. Although reports of similar cases are scarce,
caution should be made in prescribing CBZ to patients who either have cardiac
conduction abnormalities or undergo cardiac surgery.

A case of complete atrioventricular (AV) block of congenital origin in a
16-month-old Holstein heifer was studied histologically with serial sectioning of
the cardiac conduction system. The heart was enlarged and showed moderate
dilatation of the left and right ventricles. Histologically, the abnormally
placed and poorly formed AV bundle was observed in association with abnormality
in the tricuspid extension of the central fibrous body, suggesting that the
pathological state of the AV bundle had been responsible for the complete AV
block. This type of anatomical fault in the AV bundle is considered to be part of
an embryological, developmental malformation of the central fibrous body.

block. At a gestational age of 29 weeks the patient was delivered by cesarean
section followed by unsuccessful drug treatment of the atrioventricular block.
Sixty-five minutes after birth the patient underwent permanent pacemaker
implantation. Through a subxyphoid approach, a lead was fixed to the epicardium
of the right ventricle, and connected to a pulse generator inserted between the
rectus abdominus muscle and posterior rectus sheath. The patient is alive and
well 16 months after the operation without pacemaker failure.

We report a case where fetal echocardiography identified both complete heart
block and ventricular tachycardia. The mother tested positive for anti-Ro
antibodies. Prenatal detection of this unusual combination of arrhythmias
prompted early postnatal evaluation, which revealed prolongation of the QT
interval. Autoimmune mediated congenitally complete heart block associated with
such prolongation of the QT interval has a poor prognosis. The child was
successfully treated with beta blockers and implantation of a pacemaker.

Autoimmune-associated congenital heart block: treatment of the mother with
immunoadsorption.

Autoimmune-associated congenital heart block (CHB) is a rare complication of
pregnancy in mothers with Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies (SSA-abs), resulting in fetal
myocarditis, atrioventricular block, hydrops fetalis and/or intrauterine fetal
death. As these antibodies are supposed to be directly involved in the
pathogenesis of CHB, their removal should be associated with an improved clinical
course. Extracorporeal immunoadsorption (IA) is the most efficient method to
remove IgG-immunoglobulins like SSA-abs selectively. Two women with high titers
of those auto-antibodies [mothers serum 615 and 612, respectively (normal range
<3.0 IU/mL)] were treated with IA two to three times per gestation week in the
outpatient department of the University of Rostock. In both patients, the mean
removal of IgG (65 +/- 6%) to a target near 2.0 g/L after IA was successful. The 
SSA-abs were reduced from mean 328 +/- 138 and 247 +/- 105 pre IA to 88 +/- 124
and 98 +/- 42 post IA, respectively. One child received a pacemaker due to the
persisting atrioventricular block grade III after birth. The second was
unaffected. The removal of highly elevated SSA-antibodies by immunoadsorption is 
a possible treatment option in pregnant woman with high titers of those
antibodies and/or a positive history of clinical complications. Further clinical 
studies are necessary.

Beneficial hemodynamic response of transthoracic cardiac pacing in a 2 kg preterm
neonate.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the beneficial hemodynamic effect of transthoracic
external pacing compared with epicardial pacing in a 2 kg premature neonate with 
congenital complete heart block, hydrops and complex congenital heart disease.
METHODS: Transthoracic epicardial pacing was instituted at a rate of 120
beats/min to treat life-threatening bradycardia (HR 50-60 beats/min), hypotension
(BP 45/20 mmHg) and severe lactic acidosis (pH 7.18, lactate 7.5 mmol/l) despite 
significant catecholamine support. Due to the size of the patient, the external
pacing electrodes were placed on the back and front of the patient's chest. To
achieve ventricular capture, the electric output had to be increased to 140 mA,
resulting in symmetric chest movements.
RESULT: Transthoracic pacing resulted in an immediate improvement of the
cardiovascular status, with an adequate blood pressure (BP 60/25 mmHg) and
normalization of acid-base-balance. After the insertion of an epicardial
pacemaker (paced rate at 140 beats/min), a significantly lower blood pressure was
achieved (BP 50/25 mmHg), indicating an additive effect of the rhythmic chest
movements to the blood pressure. Unfortunately, third-degree burns were detected 
on the patients back 1 day after pacemaker insertion.
CONCLUSION: Transthoracic pacing is a life-saving option in an emergency
situation, when maximal pharmacological support fails to maintain adequate
cardiac output. It may have some additional beneficial effect on blood pressure
generation in these patients. To prevent skin injury, the output used needs to be
as low as feasible, and the period of pacing as brief as practicable.

Noncompaction of ventricular myocardium in a patient with congenitally corrected

Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.

Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a rare disorder that represents
numerous prominent trabeculations and intratrabecular recesses in the ventricles.
It is believed to represent not only an arrest in endomyocardial morphogenesis
but also an unclassified cardiomyopathy. The pathology has been almost invariably
associated with other congenital cardiac malformations. A female patient with
noncompaction of the myocardium of both ventricles and congenitally corrected
transposition of the great arteries (cTGA), situs inversus totalis, and atrial
and ventricular septal defects is described. When she was 7 days old a permanent 
pacemaker was implanted because of complete heart block. Prazosin (Minipress), an
alpha-receptor blocker, was administered, and the cardiac ejection fraction
showed a striking increase from 20% to 42%. Despite careful and regular follow-up
evaluations, the general condition of the patient slowly worsened. Five months
after surgery she died of hepatorenal failure and low cardiac output. This case
report is thought to be the first description of congenital complete heart block,
cTGA, and situs inversus totalis with noncompaction of the myocardium of both
ventricles.

We report a case of isolated congenital complete atrioventricular block with left
ventricular dysfunction after pacemaker implantation that improved after the
pacing site was changed. During the neonatal period, a pacemaker wire was
implanted on the right ventricular epicardium and pacing was initiated. Decreased
ejection fraction and a perfusion defect around the septum on myocardial
scintigraphy were observed during follow-up. Induced left bundle branch block was
thought to be causing interventricular asynchrony, and the pacing site was change
to the left ventricular epicardium. Ejection fraction improved and the perfusion 
defect resolved. Lead relocation may be useful for left ventricular dysfunction
that develops during right ventricular pacing.

University, Seyhan-Adana, Turkey. er_aslan@yahoo.com

BACKGROUND: As in most other autoimmune diseases, Sjögren's syndrome is seen
predominantly in women. Since the peak age is around the late reproductive and
early postmenopausal period, the obstetric aspect has not been well studied.
CASE: A 28-years-old woman, pregnant for 22 weeks and 5 days, was admitted with
worsening general status, skin lesions, arthralgias, and oral and ocular symptoms
typical of Sjögren's syndrome. She underwent hemodialysis for renal
insufficiency. To prevent autoantibody formation, progression of the disease,
therapy with methyl prednisolone, 100 mg/d intravenously; cyclophosphamide, 500
mg/month in a single intravenous application; hemodialysis 3 times a week; and
plasmapheresis 7 times was instituted. An 1,100-g, male infant at 27 weeks and 5 
days was delivered by cesarean section because of premature preterm rupture of
membranes and severe late decelerations on cardiotocography. The infant was
discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit after 30 days, weighing 1,800 g.
Postnatal echocardiographic examination of the infant revealed neither cardiac
malformations nor arrhythmias.
CONCLUSION: Since the presence of autoantibodies against SS-A and SS-B are
reported to accompany congenital heart block, the primary goal of therapy should 
be preventing this untoward effect of the disease. Close monitoring during
pregnancy is mandatory to detect preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation
and preterm labor.

Congenital absence of the pericardium is an uncommon finding that may or may not 
be symptomatic. Asymptomatic patients are discovered incidentally during cardiac 
surgery for an unrelated condition or postmortem. However, symptomatic patients
may experience non-exertional paroxysmal stabbing chest pain. It may occur with
other cardiac or extracardiac abnormalities and a variety of imaging modalities
may identify the condition. Complete cases are more rare than partial effects.
However, complications are more common with partial absence due to strangulation 
of the heart into the defect thus requiring surgical intervention.

Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (CTGA) is an uncommon 
congenital cardiac anomaly. Prenatal sonographic diagnosis of CTGA is very
difficult because the ventricular outflow tract may appear to arise correctly
from the right and left ventricles. Few cases of CTGA diagnosed in utero have
been reported. We report a case of CTGA with complete heart block, ventricular
septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis diagnosed at 30 weeks' gestation after
the mother was referred to our hospital because of persistent fetal bradycardia.

Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect during
infancy. It is composed of a ventricular septal defect, an overriding aorta,
obstruction of right ventricular outflow, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Most
patients experience cyanosis at birth and die in childhood without surgical
intervention. The rate of survival at 40 years without surgical correction is
only 3%. We present the case of a man with tetralogy of Fallot who survived until
the age of 52 years without surgical intervention.

BACKGROUND: The neonatal lupus syndrome can be present as congenital heart block 
(CHB) or as neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE), both seldom passively acquired
autoimmune diseases. CHB starts around week 20 of pregnancy and is a lifelong
event, whereas NLE is self limiting and usually starts at the 6th week of the
child's age-the maximum recorded up to week 20.
CASE REPORT: An asymptomatic mother with primary Sjogren's syndrome and
anti-SSA/Ro52, anti-SSA/Ro60, and anti-SSB/La autoantibodies is described who, at
gestational week 23 during her first pregnancy, was diagnosed as having a male
fetus with CHB due to third degree atrioventricular block. The boy from the
second pregnancy developed skin eruptions which clinically and by biopsy were
compatible with NLE at week 20+1 post partum.
CONCLUSIONS: Our case of NLE, starting at week 20+1 of age, seems to be the
latest reported clinical case of NLE. Development of CHB and NLE in two
consecutive boy pregnancies is unusual.

A 4-year-old boy with congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB) and
pacemaker (PM) dependency, received a redundant pacemaker. Two separate leads
were implanted in the right ventricle, and connected to a dual chamber PM. The
two pacing channels were both programmed so that each lead could compensate for
the other in case of threshold elevation. The follow-up was uneventful despite
exit block on one of the leads.

Neonatal Lupus Syndrome is a rare disease caused by placental passage of maternal
autoantibodies. Pathogenesis is partially unknown and many clinical
manifestations are possible. We report on newborn siblings who presented with
different symptoms of Neonatal Lupus Syndrome. One patient presented with
congenital heart block and another with hepatic and haematologic involvement.
Cases of Neonatal Lupus among siblings are very rare, because of the high risk of
pregnancy in affected women. Various clinical expressions may be explained by a
different specificity of Anti-Ro autoantibodies among siblings. The reported
cases are commented with regard to recent literature, trying to explain their
pathogenesis.

Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital heart defect. Patients with severe
symptomatic tricuspid regurgitation requiring surgical correction often have
conduction system disease. We present a case of a 14 year-old girl with Ebstein's
malformation and bioprosthetic tricuspid valve who required permanent pacing for 
symptomatic bradycardia. The placement of the right ventricular pacing lead was
facilitated by the use of the Doppler pulmonary artery velocity time integral as 
a surrogate for stroke volume. This case demonstrates the importance of
site-specific pacing and the utility of Doppler echocardiography to optimize lead
placement and cardiac performance in patients with Ebstein's anomaly and advanced
conduction system disease.

First-degree heart block in the fetus of an anti-SSA/Ro-positive mother: reversal
after a short course of dexamethasone treatment.

Isolated congenital heart block is almost invariably associated with the presence
of antibodies to SSA/Ro and SSB/La antigens in the maternal circulation. Once
established, third-degree congenital heart block is permanent. However, a lesser 
degree of autoantibody-associated heart block in a fetus can be reversed if it is
recognized and treated early enough with fluorinated glucocorticosteroids. The
only method available clinically for the recognition of first-degree heart block 
in a fetus is measurement of the mechanical PR interval by pulsed Doppler
echocardiography. This is the first report of a fetus in whom a diagnosis of
first-degree heart block and the consequent decision to intervene were based
solely on this technique. In addition, the first-degree heart block resolved
completely after only 2 weeks of dexamethasone treatment, and the heart rhythm
remained stable throughout the remainder of the pregnancy despite early
discontinuation of therapy due to oligohydramnios.

Dilated cardiomyopathy associated with dual-chamber pacing in infants:
improvement through either left ventricular cardiac resynchronization or
programming the pacemaker off allowing intrinsic normal conduction.

The etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with congenital complete AV
block has not yet been clarified. Two infants with AV block of autoimmune and
surgical etiology, respectively, had received a dual-chamber right
ventricular-based pacemaker and developed dilated cardiomyopathy with severe
septal to left ventricular free-wall dyssynchrony 3.4 (0.9) years later. After 4 
weeks of biventricular pacing and spontaneous junctional narrow QRS rhythm,
respectively, both children showed significant improvement in left ventricular
function along with reverse remodeling. Thus, electromechanical dyssynchrony
associated with conventional right-ventricular-based DDD pacing may play a
significant role in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in the young.

Congenital heart block (CHB) associated with maternal anti-SSA/SSB antibodies: a 
report of four cases. CHB detected in utero is strongly associated with maternal 
antibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La). Their pathogenic role in the development of 
CHB has been established in several studies. The mothers of affected infants
frequently had autoimmune disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's
syndrome) or were entirely asymptomatic. It is very difficult to identify
pregnant asymptomatic mothers carrying anti-SSA/SSB antibodies. We report four
cases of infants born to asymptomatic mothers with anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, three
of them developed isolated congenital cardiac heart block and one with no
evidence of CHB. All three CHB are detected during pregnancy between 16 and 24
weeks of gestation. All maternal sera contained antibodies to SSA alone or the
both SSA and SSB. Three of four subsequent pregnancies were complicated by heart 
block. One child affected died in utero. While the two other newborns with CHB
required pacemaker insertion during the first 3 months of life. Although the
association of anti-SSA/SSB with CHB is widely accepted, the precise mechanism by
which these antibodies cause cardiac conduction abnormalities remains to be
defined. Antibodies to SSA/SSB have been proposed to be a serologic marker for
neonatal lupus syndrome and CHB. Fetal and neonatal diseases are presumed to be
due to the transplacental passage of these IgG autoantibodies from the mother
into the fetal circulation. Since these antibodies may have a pathogenic role in 
CHB, screening of infants with isolated CHB or neonatal lupus and their mothers
for the presence of anti-SSA and anti-SSB is strongly recommended.

A 50-year-old man with a heart murmur from early childhood and a one year history
of general fatigue was admitted. Cardiac examination showed a left
ventricular-right atrial (LV-RA) communication, and aortic and mitral valve
regurgitation (III/IV). At surgery, the LV-RA communication was located in the
atrioventricular membranous portion 3 mm above the septal leaflet of the
tricuspid valve. The etiology of the LV-RA communication was congenital and
valvular diseases were acquired changes caused by sclerosis due to infected
endocarditis or hypertension. The diameter of the LV-RA communication defect was 
6 mm, and the fibrous tissue around the defect was closed directly. Next,
double-valve replacement was performed safely. However, the day after surgery,
the patient developed complete atrioventricular block and implantation of a DDD
pacemaker was required. He was discharged without other complication. We
recommend the careful closure of the LV-RA communication defect, if the defect is
small and rich in fibrous tissue.

the installation of a permanent pacemaker because of the existence of congenital 
complete heart block (CCHB) with a basal heart rate of 43 b.min(-1) and minimal
elevation after initiating an isoproterenol perfusion. The intervention was under
general anaesthesia with laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and spontaneous ventilation.
The principal anaesthetic goals were to assure adequate anaesthesia, with
haemodynamic and respiratory stability, to maintain the best possible heart rate 
and to avoid postoperative respiratory depression or apnoea.

Fetuses with complete heart block have an increased mortality with most deaths
occurring in utero or during infancy. The cardiac evaluation of these fetuses is 
difficult since the ventricular rate is low and the heart is dilated. We have
implemented a strategy that includes the biophysical profile, which assesses
fetal well-being, in combination with the cardiovascular profile that assesses
cardiac function and the circulation. We present two cases of fetal complete
heart block in which early delivery was recommended due to worsening
cardiovascular profile scores. Biophysical profile scores were normal. Both
babies were successfully treated, despite having risk factors that predicted poor
outcomes. We hypothesize that our management protocol initiated intervention
before fetal compromise, hydrops, and myocardial damage occurred. We recommend an
evaluation of heart function in addition to an assessment of fetal well-being in 
fetuses with complete heart block. Early delivery should be considered if there
is evidence of distress and/or deteriorating cardiac function.

disease. Here, the septal defect was identified in the perimembranous area and a 
pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio of 1.4:1 was calculated. At coronary
angiography, a single coronary artery was found. This particular anomaly
consisted of a proximal right coronary artery originating from a septal branch of
the left anterior descending coronary artery and a distal right coronary artery
arising from the distal left circumflex artery. Such an association constitutes
an exceedingly rare congenital condition.

Congenital auriculo-ventricular blocks (CAVB) are usually linked to maternal
auto-immune diseases and their management remains controversial. We report three 
cases of CAVB in preterm newborns managed using electro-stimulation with an
external, followed by an internal pacemaker. Results and long-term follow-up were
satisfactory in all three children.CONCLUSION: the transitory placement of an
external pacemaker seems necessary in low birth weight infants in order to allow 
weight gain and therefore the insertion of a permanent pacemaker. The prognosis
seems good but a regular echocardiographic surveillance is of great importance in
order to detect the onset of cardiac failure secondary to dilated cardiomyopathy.

BACKGROUND: Complete heart block is the most common congenital heart block
diagnosed in the fetalneonatal period. Maternal administration of
beta-sympathomimetic agents has been used to treat this condition in the fetus.
We know of no previous reports of the delivery of beta-sympathomimetics via a
continuous subcutaneous pump for management of this condition.
CASE: An intrauterine gestation at 28 5/7 weeks complicated by fetal congenital
complete heart block was successfully managed to term with maternal
administration of a beta-sympathomimetic agent via a continuous subcutaneous
pump.
CONCLUSION: Maternal administration of beta-sympathomimetic agents by a
continuous subcutaneous pump in cases of fetal congenital complete heart block
may help prolong pregnancy by preventing hydrops fetalis and avoiding confounding
problems of prematurity. However, it should be used with caution due to the
potential for dilated cardiomyopathy in the infant.

Isolated congenital sick sinusal syndrome on non harmed heart is a rare
affection. Its association with an atrio-ventricular block is exceptional. The
authors report a case of a 19 year-old patient, with an early history of
bradycardia, hospitalised for effort intolerance. His electrocardiogram reveals a
high degree sino-atrial block replaced by a junctional rhythm at 30/mn. During
Treadmill test, the sinusal acceleration is satisfactory and an effort
atrio-ventricular block was present. He later had a definitive stimulation under 
DDDR. This report shows that the sinusal node, in the same way as the
atrio-ventricular node may be injured by congenital dysimmunitary process. The
coexistence of these two conductive troubles worsen the prognosis and should lead
more often to the practice of definitive stimulation by the only mode DDDR.

The benefit of a dual chamber pacemaker and the atrial and ventricular
synchronization in patients with two ventricles is widely accepted. The purpose
of this study was to choose the optimal AV interval in patients with congenital
heart disease after definitive palliation of univentricular hearts. Therefore,
different AV intervals were programmed and hemodynamic aspects were examined by
Doppler echocardiography. The interval found was different from normal heart
morphology and two ventricular hemodynamics.

It is known that maternal immunological factors such as systemic disease are
involved in the genesis of cardiac conduction problems in the fetus but the
histologic changes in the conduction system are less documented. We report the
case of a 33-year-old woman with no significant medical history. Her first
pregnancy was induced by Clomifene. At 17 weeks of gestation, the fetus presented
sonographic abnormalities characteristic of a complete atrioventricular block.
Biological investigations found anti-SSA and -SSB antibodies. Clinical history
search for systemic disease was positive for photosensitivity, lasting 10 years, 
suggesting the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient was treated
with prednisone 20 mg per day but fetal death occurred at 29 weeks of gestation. 
Histological examination of the fetal heart showed an altered atrioventricular
node and bundle of His with fibrosis, calcifications, endocardial fibroelastosis 
and mononucleated inflammatory cells. The search for these specific lesions can
be determinant in establishing the disease pathogenesis; also, it is important to
eliminate this diagnosis in an unexplained fetal death.

Congenital ectopic junctional tachycardia (EJT) is a rare arrhythmia presenting
in the first 6 months of life. It is often resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and 
its poor prognosis (35% mortality) explains its often complex management. The
authors report two cases which illustrate its unpredictability with a potential
to degenerate to serious ventricular arrhythmias. The possibility of progression 
to atrioventricular block, increased by antiarrhythmic therapy, may lead to
implantation of a cardiac pacemaker. The poor outcome of the two babies
underlines the severity of these arrhythmias.

cyanotic heart disease. Before taking roxithromycin, her corrected QT interval
(QTc) was 0.39 second with a ventricular rate of 55-60 beats/min. Repetitive
bursts of TdP with prolonged QT interval (QTc = 0.55 s) developed after taking
roxithromycin. After stopping the medication, her QT interval normalized (QTc =
0.38 s). This case demonstrated the potential of roxithromycin in causing TdP
especially in a patient with other risk factors for prolong QT interval and TdP.

Hematological complications of systemic lupus erythematosus usually include
anemia of chronic disease and peripheral destruction of blood cells. We describe 
the case of a young woman with Sjögren's syndrome'lupus erythematosus overlap,
mother of infant with congenital heart block, complicated by pure red cell
aplasia. The patient was asymptomatic until the onset of severe anemia. A serum
inhibitor of erythropoiesis was detected before the onset of immunosuppression.
Bone marrow examination showed a low CD4:CD8 ratio, an immune defect possibly
linked with the unrestrained production of antibodies against erythroid
progenitor cells.

Successful outcome in a fetus with an extremely low heart rate due to isolated
complete congenital heart block.

Isolated complete congenital heart block (CCHB) in a fetus is usually associated 
with the presence of autoantibodies to SSA (Ro) and SSB (La) antigens in the
maternal circulation. Although the prognosis for the majority of fetuses is good,
it is less favorable in fetuses with a ventricular rate < 55 bpm in early
pregnancy or with a decrease in the ventricular rate by >/= 5 bpm during
pregnancy. It is not known if the same prognostic criteria apply for the
occasional fetus with isolated non-autoimmune CCHB. We report a case of a single 
fetus with an isolated non-autoimmune CCHB with an extremely low ventricular rate
(37 bpm) in which the outcome was favorable. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare
complication in patients with isolated CCHB, despite early institution of cardiac
pacing, and is usually recognized after several months of relative well-being. It
is assumed that in the majority of patients it represents a sequel to in utero
autoimmune or postnatal reactivation myocarditis. However, the possibility of a
tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy caused by an excessively high pacing rate
should also be taken into consideration, as was clearly demonstrated in our
patient.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an immune-mediated disease associated with the
transplacental passage of maternal autoantibodies, primarily anti-Ro (SS-A) and
anti-La (SS-B). The major clinical manifestations are isolated congenital heart
block and cutaneous lupus lesions. Other symptoms include hematologic and hepatic
abnormalities. We report a male neonate, born to a mother with Sjögren's
syndrome, who experienced cutaneous lupus lesions and 2 episodes of pancytopenia.
Both anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies were positive in infant and mother.

We report a case of a fetus presenting with bradycardia, intermittent
atrioventricular (AV) block, ventricular tachycardia (VT) and the signs of fetal 
congestive heart failure (ascites and scrotal hydrocele) during mid-gestation.
Prenatal treatment with beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol) and digitalis
glycosides was prescribed because of suspicion of long QT syndrome occurring with
fetal congestive heart failure. The male baby was born at 39 weeks of gestation
and showed a prolonged QT interval (QTc = 492 ms) and frequent variable AV block 
or alternating left and right bundle branch block, depending on the atrial rate. 
Prenatal administration of lidocaine failed to correct the fetal VT. Conversely, 
propranolol decreased the attack frequency of fetal VT. Postnatal administration 
of the K(+) channel opener (nicorandil) successfully shortened the QT interval
and improved the outcome.

Favorable outcome in a pregnancy with complete fetal heart block and severe
bradycardia.

Minassian VA(1), Jazayeri A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Texas Tech University Health Sciences
Center, Lubbock, Texas, USA.

BACKGROUND: Pregnancies complicated by congenital heart block usually have a poor
prognosis when there is severe fetal bradycardia.
CASE: We present a pregnancy with fetal heart rate of 40 beats per minute. She
previously delivered a child with third-degree heart block by cesarean at 28
weeks. This pregnancy was complicated by a high ribonucleoprotein antibody
anti-Ro/SSA titer and fetal bradycardia. The patient was treated with steroids
and beta-mimetics. The fetus continued to grow normally with reassuring
biophysical profiles. After fetal lung maturity documentation at 34 weeks, she
delivered by repeat cesarean a healthy 2349-g infant who required a permanent
pacemaker.
CONCLUSION: Reassuring antepartum testing and normal growth in pregnant women
with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and congenital heart block may allow expectant
management until fetal maturity.

Congenital heart block (CHB) is rather rare, and a poorer prognosis has been
documented in fetuses with a ventricular rate <55 beats per minutes (bpm), in
which therapeutic interventions during pregnancy have been warranted. We present 
a case of CHB associated with maternal anti-SSA/Ro antibody, diagnosed at 28
weeks' gestation. Fetal echocardiography revealed atrioventricular dissociation, 
with an atrial rate of 170 bpm and a ventricular rate of 54 bpm. To increase the 
fetal heart rate, maternal intravenous ritodrine infusion was undertaken, fetal
ventricular rate was rapidly increased to 65 bpm. The pregnancy successfully
continued until term, and a female infant weighing 2919 g was delivered by
cesarean section with Apgar scores of 8 and 8 and 1 and 5 min. The infant is now 
12 months of age and growing normally on oral terbutaline without pacing. In a
case of fetal heart block, maternal administration of ritodrine may be a
therapeutic intervention to improve the fetal and neonatal prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare syndrome (affecting 5% of
the children born of mothers with lupus), characterized essentially by cutaneous 
lesions and/or congenital auricular-ventricular heart block. It is due to the
transplacental passage of maternal antibodies (anti-SSA or anti-SSB, or
occasionally anti-U1RNP antibodies) into the fetal circulation.
OBSERVATION: We report a case of neonatal lupus erythematosus, having appeared 4 
weeks after birth. The 26 years old mother exhibited systemic lupus erythematosus
concomitant to Gougerot-Sjögren's syndrome, with positive antinuclear factors
(1/2560), native anti-DNA, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies and anticardiolipin
antibodies. During pregnancy, the mother had been treated with aspirin at the
dose of 100 mg/day, followed by subcutaneous enoxaparin 0.4 ml/day, and combined 
with prednisone 10 mg/d and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day. Early and regular
cardiac monitoring of the foetus was performed. The clinical examination and the 
electrocardiogram at birth were normal. Four weeks later, the infant presented
with erythematous cutaneous lesions with atrophic center. No systemic treatment
was initiated and the lesions partially regressed.
CONCLUSION: Cutaneous lesions can also appear after the 4th week of life. It is
important that the pediatricians clinically monitor all the children born to
mothers exhibiting anti-SSA or anti-SSB antibodies, at least during the first 7
months of life.

Exercise-induced bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with alternating right and
left bundle branch block-type patterns--a case report.

Khan IA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, NE,
USA. ikhan@cardiac.creighton.edu

Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia in young adults may occur with various
structural heart diseases or with structurally normal heart. The structural heart
diseases reported to cause exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia in this
patient population include arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia,
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congenital
heart disease, and myocardial ischemia. The conditions well identified to cause
exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia with structurally normal heart are
congenital long-QT syndrome and familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia may display polymorphic, monomorphic, or
bidirectional morphologies. A case of exercise-induced catecholamine-sensitive
bidirectional ventricular tachycardia with alternating right and left bundle
branch block patterns is reported in a young boy in the absence of structural
heart disease, the conditions causing bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, and 
family history of such an event or sudden cardiac death. The bidirectional
tachycardia typically displays right bundle branch block in right precordial
leads with alternating polarity of the QRS-complex in frontal plane leads but in 
this case the bidirectional morphology of tachycardia was caused by alternating
right and left bundle branch block-type patterns. The conditions causing
bidirectional ventricular tachycardia are digoxin toxicity, ischemic heart
disease, hypokalemia, myocarditis, and familial polymorphic ventricular
tachycardia syndrome but the exact cause in this patient remained obscure, and
the possibility of an underlying electrical or ion channel disease of the heart
could not be ruled out.

Kung University Hospital, No. 138, Sheng Li Road, Tainan 70428, Taiwan.

Complete atrioventricular block (CAVB) can be either congenital or acquired in
children. Acquired CAVB is occasionally seen in myocarditis patients. To
determine the etiology, natural history, and outcome of children with acquired
nonsurgical CAVB, we retrospectively reviewed nine children who had suffered CAVB
caused by suspected infectious myocarditis. All of them had CAVB with a wide QRS 
escape ventricular rhythm on admission. Three of them had ventricular tachycardia
in addition to CAVB. Seven of them had a preceding upper respiratory tract
infection. All of them had congestive heart failure. Five of them had
Stokes-Adams seizures. Three etiologies were identified in four of the children. 
All patients received inotropic agents and emergency temporary pacing. In all
except one case, the cardiac rhythm returned to sinus rhythm within 10 days.
During a follow-up period of 9 to 96 months, all were asymptomatic and drug-free.
Electrocardiograms showed that four patients were completely normal, there was
complete RBBB in four and left anterior fascicular block in one patient. We
conclude that although CAVB associated with myocarditis can be life-threatening, 
the long-term prognosis is good if patients are diagnosed early and proper
management is employed.

the Netherlands. h.quartero@interstroom.nl

OBJECTIVES: To test the usefulness and reliability of fetal magnetocardiography
as a diagnostic or screening tool, both for fetuses with arrhythmias as well as
for fetuses with a congenital heart defect.
METHODS: We describe 21 women with either a fetal arrhythmia or a congenital
heart defect discovered during prenatal evaluation by sonography. Four fetuses
showed a complete atrioventricular block, two an atrial flutter, nine ventricular
extrasystole, and one a complete irregular heart rate. Five fetuses were
suspected to have a congenital heart defect. In all cases magnetocardiograms were
recorded.
RESULTS: Nine fetuses with extrasystole showed a range of premature atrial
contractions, premature junctional beats or premature ventricular contractions.
Two fetuses with atrial flutter showed typical flutter waves and four fetuses
with complete atrioventricular block showed an uncoupling of P-wave and QRS
complex. One fetus showed a pattern suggestive of a bundle branch block. In three
of four fetuses with confirmed congenital heart defects the magnetocardiogram
showed abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: Fetal magnetocardiography allows an insight into the
electrophysiological aspects of the fetal heart, is accurate in the
classification of fetal arrhythmias, and shows potential as a tool in defining a 
population at risk for congenital heart defects.

Congenital quadricuspid aortic valve is very uncommon, and is often associated
with other cardiac disorders, such as patent ductus, ventricular septal defect,
pulmonary stenosis, mitral valve malformation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
coronary abnormalities. We report a patient with congenital quadricuspid aortic

Li Road, Tainan, Taiwan.

Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) with atrioventricular block is a rare and
malignant arrhythmia, which usually responds poorly to traditional beta-blocker
therapy. We describe a male neonate with LQTS with ventricular tachycardia and
2:1 atrioventricular block. This patient's sister had similar presentation and
died suddenly at the age of 8 months despite beta-blocker and pacemaker therapy. 
Our patient responded to a combination of sodium channel blocker (mexiletine) and
beta-blocker (propranolol) therapy. He was asymptomatic during a 2-year follow-up
period. This case suggests that propranolol combined with mexiletine might be
useful in the treatment of patients with LQTS with atrioventricular block.

Ventricular noncompaction is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized by numerous,
prominent ventricular trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses and is
caused by a disorder of endomyocardial morphogenesis. It can occur in patients
with other congenital anomalies, such as various ventricular obstructive lesions,
or in isolated form in the absence of associated anomalies. Patients with this
unique disease may present with heart failure, systemic emboli, and ventricular
arrhythmias. In this case report, we present an unusual coexistence of
ventricular noncompaction and atrial septal aneurysm and mitral valve cleft in a 
young patient who presented with complete AV-block.

an accessory pathway with long conduction times was detected. Periods of
atrioventricular conduction alternated with periods of atrioventricular block.
Sinus tachycardia and 1:1 exclusive conduction through the accessory pathway
developed with increased sympathic activity (exercise, isoproterenol infusion).
We discuss the special features of this case.

We report our experience of pacemaker treatment in a premature infant of 832
grams with congenital complete atrioventricular block due to maternal Sjögren's
Syndrome. She was delivered by cesarean section at an estimated gestational age
of 26 weeks because of fetal bradycardia, decreasing fetal movements and hydrops.
Immediate postnatal transesophageal ventricular pacing was not successful,
whereas transthoracic pacing with self-adhesive patch electrodes adapted to body 
size resulted in an effective increase of the infant's heart rate until operative
application of temporary epimyocardial pacing wires ensured the external
stimulation of the heart.

At the age of 4 years, a total cavopulmonary connection was performed in a boy
with a complex congenital heart defect. On addition, a DDDR pacemaker was
implanted for sick sinus syndrome. Atrial and ventricular leads were epicardially
placed at the left atrium and left ventricle. At the age of 10 years, a new
epicardial ventricular lead was placed because of malfunction of the existing
lead. At the same operation the pulse generator was replaced by a Medtronic Kappa
DR 731. After replacement, the boy experienced episodes of phrenic nerve
stimulation associated with feelings of discomfort. Holter recordings revealed
ventricular stimulation from the atrial stimulus for 2 consecutive beats. This
phenomenon repeated exactly every 3 hours and was caused by the automatic lead
impedance measurement that used a 5-V, 1-ms stimulus output.

neonatal lupus erythematosus and congenital heart block developed central nervous
system vasculopathy resembling moyamoya disease and hypertension at 17 years of
age. Careful examination and follow-up of possible central nervous system
complications later in life might be important in infants with neonatal lupus
erythematosus.

We report a case of 2:1 atrioventricular block associated with acquired long QT
syndrome. A newborn presented to our neonatal intensive care unit with
intermittent bradycardia due to 2:1 atrioventricular block. Initial evaluation
showed QT prolongation and significant electrolytic abnormalities. After
correction of the electrolytic imbalance, the QT interval normalized and
atrioventricular block resolved. Compared to congenital long QT syndrome with 2:1
atrioventricular block, acquired long QT syndrome with comparable
atrioventricular block has a benign prognosis, provided treatment is initiated
quickly.

We report a case of fetal congenital heart block treated with maternal
administration of beta-sympathomimetics. The case was diagnosed as fetal complete
heart block associated with maternal anti-Ro/SS-A antibody at 22 weeks of
gestation. By fetal sonography, the ventricular rate was revealed to be 60
beats/min and mild cardiomegaly was shown. We initiated maternal administration
of a sympathomimetic, specifically terbutaline, to prevent fetal heart failure.
An increase in the fetal ventricular rate and an improvement in cardiac function 
were both achieved during the treatment. A viable infant was delivered by an
elective cesarean section without complications at term. Maternal administration 
of the beta-adrenergic agent terbutaline is suggested to be effective for
improving fetal congenital heart block in order to prevent heart failure in
utero.

Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding cardiac ionic channel subunits KCNQ1,
HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2 are causally involved in the dominant form of
long-QT syndrome (LQTS) while homozygous mutations in KCNQ1 and KCNE1 cause LQTS 
with or without congenital deafness. In addition, two homozygous HERG mutations
have been associated with severe LQTS with functional atrioventricular conduction
anomalies in young children. A 2:1 atrioventricular block (AVB) with a major QTc 
prolongation (526 ms) was evidenced in a 5-year-old boy referred for syncope and 
seizure. LQTS was diagnosed and beta-blocking therapy initiated leading to normal
atrioventricular conduction. Electrophysiological study provided support that
location of the AVB was infra-Hisian. DNA analysis was performed in the proband
and in asymptomatic family members. A novel missense mutation, V1777M, in the
early C-terminal domain of SCN5A was identified. The proband was homozygous while
the parents and two siblings were heterozygous carriers. Homozygote and
heterozygote expression of the mutant channels in tsA201 mammalian cells resulted
in a persistent inward sodium current of 3.96+/-0.83% and 1.49+/-0.47% at -30 mV,
respectively, which was dramatically reduced in the presence of tetrodotoxin.
This study provides the first evidence for a homozygous missense mutation in
SCN5A and suggests that LQTS with functional 2:1 AVB in young children, a severe 
phenotype associated with bad prognosis, may be caused by homozygous or
heterozygous compound mutations not only in HERG but also in SCN5A. The full text

The implantation of permanent pacemakers in patients with congenital heart
disease can be challenging. This report describes the complexity of pacemaker
implantation in a patient with Ebstein's disease, tricuspid valve replacement,
and right atrial abnormalities like severe intra- and interatrial conduction
block that prevented dual chamber pacing from conventional sites. This case
illustrates the promising possibility to circumvent the interatrial conduction
block with single left atrial pacing instead of biatrial pacing which was not
suitable here.

Prenatal diagnosis of persistent fetal bradycardia: report of four cases.

Huang HW(1), Chang SY, Changchien CC, Hsu YH, Hsu TY.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
Kaohsiung.

Persistent fetal bradycardia is infrequent in prenatal life and difficult to
manage optimally. It is generally attributable to sinus bradycardia due to fetal 
distress, blocked atrial extrasystoles, and congenital complete heart block. We
reported four cases of persistent fetal bradycardia from 1995 to 1999 in our
hospital. The first, second, and third cases of sustained fetal bradycardia had
congenital complete heart block with positive titers for anti-Ro/SSA antibodies
in both mothers and fetuses. Because of progressive fetal hydrops in the second
case, the pregnancy was terminated. The first and third cases were isolated
congenital complete heart block without structural anomaly. After prenatal
examination the babies were followed up closely until term and both had a good
prognosis without any implantation of pacemaker. In the fourth case there was no 
clinically known etiology associated with sustained fetal bradycardia. The fetal 
heart rate returned to normal after 6 weeks of follow-up and the baby was
delivered without any cardiac problems. Congenital complete heart block is the
most common cause of persistent fetal bradycardia. Prenatal detailed monitoring
until delivery is necessary before heart failure develops. Treatment strategies
(corticosteroids, ritodrine, and plasmapheresis) are debatable and may include
prophylactic therapy for high-risk pregnant women.

Atrial pacing during radiofrequency ablation of junctional ectopic tachycardia--a
useful technique for avoiding atrioventricular bloc.

Wakayama, Japan. hitoo@yo.rim.or.jp

Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) was performed on a 5-year-old boy with
congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia (JET) that was refractory to medical
management. Because of the lack of retrograde atrial depolarization during
tachycardia, radiofrequency energy was delivered during atrial overdrive pacing
to confirm the presence of preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Although
the procedure was complicated by complete right bundle branch block after
ablation of the para-Hissian region, the patient regained sinus rhythm
accompanied by normal AV conduction. Rapid atrial pacing during RFCA of JET may
be safely used to avoid AV block.

Pregnancies in women with autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB may be
associated with permanent and treatment resistant fetal atrioventricular (AV)
block. We describe a patient with primary S ogren's syndrome and anti-Ro (60 kDa 
and 52 kDa) and anti-La autoantibodies, in whom fetal bradycardia with
second-degree AV block was detected at 19 + 0 weeks of gestation. Maternal
treatment with dexamethasone (4 mg/day po) was started 2 days later. The baby's
heart rate improved gradually, returning to normal after about 6 weeks of
treatment. Our case illustrates the importance of close monitoring of the fetal
heart rate in risk-pregnancies from about week 16 of gestation and initiation of 
dexamethasone treatment without delay when a block is detected.

Congenital sick sinus syndrome with breath holding and severe syncope episodes
during infancy. A case report.

Author information:

Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.

Sick sinus syndrome is a rare cause of bradycardia in children without structural
heart disease. A case of profound sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest with junctional
escape, and pauses in a two-year-old infant with breath-holding and syncope
episodes is presented. As a result of these clinical symptoms and
electrocardiographic findings, the patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent
implantation of transvenous ventricular pacemaker. He has been well and
asymptomatic since the insertion of the pacemaker. In the differential diagnosis 
of an infant with breath-holding and syncope episodes, when these symptoms in
particular cannot be explained by other common reasons, sick sinus syndrome
should be kept in mind. This case also illustrates the importance of
electrocardiographic studies for the diagnosis.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore.

INTRODUCTION: Congenital complete heart block is an uncommon condition in the
newborn, but is known to occur with maternal systemic lupus erythematosus.
CLINICAL PICTURE: This paper presents one such baby with complete heart block who
was born premature (after a gestation of 30 weeks) and weighing 759 g.
TREATMENT: Continuous isoprnaline infusion was initially used to support the baby
while her other neonatal problems were treated. A Medtronics VV1 pacemaker was
subsequently inserted to maintain a heart rate that would be more physiologically
acceptable for the patient.
OUTCOME: This baby is currently thriving well, having been followed up for one
year.
CONCLUSIONS: The management issues, encompassing maternal and neonatal problems, 
and a review of current literature on this condition are discussed.

A newborn female underwent pacemaker implantation with epicardial pacing leads
for the treatment of bradycardia caused by congenital atrioventricular block. At 
10 months after pacemaker implantation, she was admitted with congestive heart
failure. The epicardial leads were seen to encircle the heart, and myocardial
ischemia was suggested. During cardiac catheterization she collapsed: emergency
operation was performed, but she died on postoperative day 6.

Author information:

We report successful emergency pacing followed by permanent pacemaker
implantation due to complete block in an otherwise healthy premature infant of
1,770 g. Via the umbilical vein a temporary bipolar pacing lead was placed in the
right ventricle. The lack of spontaneous improvement warranted implantation of a 
permanent pacemaker system at the age of 2 weeks. Via a transatrial approach an
endocardial unipolar screw-in lead was placed in the right ventricle and
connected to a pulse generator implanted subcutaneously. During the follow-up
period of 6 years the child has been doing well with his VVI-R pacemaker
operating at rates between 80 and 160 pulses/minute at a chronic stimulation
threshold below 0.9 V at 0.37 msec.

A 41 year old woman presented with dyspnoea at rest and swollen legs in the
emergency room of our centre. She reported a history of slowly progressing
dyspnoea and oedema in the legs. Physical examination showed signs of
biventricular congestive heart failure and dysmorphia of the face. Routine
laboratory examination revealed elevated CK levels without significant elevations
of the CK-MB isoform. ECG showed complete left bundle branch block and first
degree atrioventricular block. Echocardiography and angiography showed markedly
reduced left ventricular systolic function, the ejection fraction was 25%.
Coronary angiography excluded CAD and there was no evidence for congenital or
valvular heart disease. The patient also reported a history of a serious
complication during emergency general anaesthesia and cataracts of both eyes.
Because of the clinical and chemical findings, the history of cataracts and
complications during general anaesthesia, a systemic congenital disease of the
muscular tissue was suspected. Molecular studies revealed a trinucleotide
amplification at the myotonic dystrophy locus 19q 13.3, so the diagnosis myotonic
dystrophy Curschmann-Steinert was established. The sixteen year old son of the
patient suffered from an at this time unknown disease with retardation, muscular 
weakness and myotonia of the face. The diagnosis myotonic dystrophy was evident
because of the clinical signs and the family history.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is the most common form of congenital cardiac defect
in humans. Recently, point mutations in the cardiac homeobox gene CSX/NKX2-5 have
been reported to cause the autosomal dominant form of familial ASD. Notably, all 
the affected patients exhibit atrioventricular conduction disturbance and some of
them died suddenly. The first case of familial ASD with a mutation of the
CSX/NKX2-5 gene in a Japanese patient is reported here. Identification of
CSX/NKX2-5 mutations in ASD patients would be very important because the
existence of such mutations may predict sudden cardiac death.

Isolated congenital atrioventricular block is reported in one out of 20,000 live 
births. The optimistic view on the prognosis and indications for permanent pacing
have been modified in the last 35 years. The purpose of this report is to present
a prenatally diagnosed case, outlining the surgical technique for permanent
pacing. The infant was a male born by cesarean section, weighted 3030 grs and had
a structurally normal heart. His ECG showed complete AV block with narrow QRS,
atrial rate was 140 and ventricular rate was 55. We implanted a epicardial
pacemaker VVIR by midline laparatomy. The lead was unipolar 35 cms long screw-in 
type and was placed in the right ventricle through the xiphoid process. The
pacemaker was placed in a GoreTex bag and fixed intraperitoneal to the abdominal 
wall. The infant did well after the procedure and he was discharged in good
condition one week later. We conclude that it is appropriate to implant a
permanent pacemaker in these patients with low ventricular rate thus reducing the
risk of sudden cardiac death. The surgical technique is safe and makes easy the
generator replacement.

Fetal and neonatal arrhythmia in one of the twins--a case history.

Czeszyńska MB, Wegrzynowski J, Czajkowski Z, Dawid G.

There are a lot of publications about fetal arrhythmia in singletons, but up to
now there are no published data about fetal arrhythmia in multiple pregnancies.
In the present study a case history of fetal and neonatal arrhythmia in one of
twins from two mothers treated with betamimetic agents due to imminent preterm
labor is reported and discussed. A first case with fetal bradycardia due to
complete A-V block had congenital cordis abnormalities (VSD and PFO). The second 
case with prenatal detected extrasystoles had normal heart anatomy. Digoxin was
administered to the mother, in the aim to treat fetal arrhythmia without success,
because the baby had postnatal bradycardia. After hospitalisation in Cardiology
Department the described cases were successfully treated. In both cases the
second twins were without neonatal arrhythmia and with no structural heart
abnormalities. We summarise that in situation of detection fetal arrhythmia the
complexity of the problems experienced may warrant early referral to a tertiary
centre where the overall management of the mother, fetus and neonate, may be
undertaken.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an uncommon syndrome characterized by a
congenital heart block and/or cutaneous lesion. We report a male newborn with
neonatal lupus erythematosus presenting with complete heart block, cutaneous
lesions, and hydrops. Transplacental passage of anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La
antibodies were positive. Under the regimens of steroid for maternal systemic
lupus erythematosus, perinatal anticongestive agents, and postnatal ventricular
pacing with inotropic therapy, the infant died at the age of two days. The
prognosis of hydrops fetalis secondary to neonatal lupus with complete heart
block is usually fatal.

Successful implantation of a bipolar epicardial lead and an autocapture pacemaker
in a low-body-weight infant with congenital atrioventricular block: report of a
case.

Tomita Y(1), Imoto Y, Tominaga R, Yasui H.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, 
Fukuoka, Japan.

A permanent pacemaker system was successfully implanted into a low-body-weight
infant with congenital atrioventricular (AV) block, using a bipolar epicardial
CapSure Epi lead and an autocaptured Pacesetter Solus-micro VVIR pacemaker. The
calculated life span of the pacemaker generator is 5 years with a heart rate of
120/min and an output of 1.2 V (0.31 ms), and fortunately, its threshold was
autocaptured. Thus, we can conclude that the combination of a steroid-eluted
bipolar epicardial lead and the smallest possible autocaptured pacemaker
generator is most suitable for a neonate or young infant.

We report high precision assessment of fetal rhythm in utero in a case of
isolated congenital complete heart block using fetal magnetocardiography. The
recordings reveal a remarkably strong tendency for the atria and ventricles to
synchronize, which is manifested by the continual presence of ventriculophasic
sinus arrhythmia and frequent episodes of accrochage and isorhythmic AV
dissociation.

We report our experience of pacemaker treatment in a premature infant of 830 g
with congenital complete atrioventricular block due to maternal Sjögren's
Syndrome. The infant was delivered by cesarean section at an estimated
gestational age of 26 weeks because of fetal bradycardia, decreasing fetal
movements, and hydrops. Immediate postnatal transesophageal ventricular pacing
was not successful, whereas transthoracic pacing with self-adhesive patch
electrodes adapted to body size resulted in an effective increase of the infant's
heart rate until operative application of temporary epimyocardial pacing wires
allowed external stimulation of the heart.

Comment in
    Arthritis Rheum. 2001 Jan;44(1):242-3.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the electrocardiograms (EKGs) of infants born to mothers
with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies in order to evaluate the QT interval (the time from
the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave).
METHODS: Sera from mothers and children were analyzed for anti-Ro and anti-SSB/La
antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by Western blot
analysis. Fine specificity of anti-Ro antibodies was evaluated by solid-phase
ELISA against recombinant 52- and 60-kd proteins and by Western blot. A
retrospective chart review was conducted for EKG analysis. Twenty-eight EKG
tracings (21 from anti-Ro-positive and 7 from anti-Ro-negative infants born to
mothers with autoimmune diseases) were analyzed by a single investigator who was 
blinded to the infant's antibody status. The QT interval was measured and
corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula.
RESULTS: The mean QT interval was significantly longer in anti-Ro-positive than
in anti-Ro-negative infants, also after correction for heart rate (QTc) (P =
0.001). Nine of 21 anti-Ro-positive infants and 0 of 7 anti-Ro-negative infants
had QTc values above the upper normal limit (440 msec). A 24-hour EKG recording
was performed on 5 patients and confirmed the QT prolongation. These infants were
subsequently treated with a beta-blocker in order to prevent arrhythmias.
CONCLUSION: Infants born to mothers who carry anti-Ro autoantibodies may show QT 
interval prolongation and should be monitored with EKG during the first months of
life.

Occlusion of the subclavian or brachiocephalic vein in pacemaker or defibrillator
patients prohibits ipsilateral implantation of new leads with standard techniques
in the event of lead malfunction. Three patients are presented in whom laser
sheath extraction of a non-functional lead was performed in order to recanalise
the occluded vein and to secure a route for implantation of new leads. This
technique avoids abandoning a useful subpectoral site for pacing or defibrillator
therapy. The laser sheath does not affect normally functioning leads at the same 
site.

Pacing lead adhesions after long-term ventricular pacing via the coronary sinus.

Rosenthal E(1), Cook A.

e.rosenthal@umds.ac.uk

Left ventricular pacing via the coronary sinus is being increasingly used. There 
is little data to guide possible lead extractions that might be required in the
future. Significant adhesions to the coronary veins were found 12 years after
placing a pacing lead in the posterolateral coronary vein in a man with double
inlet left ventricle and severe subpulmonary stenosis who had undergone a Fontan 
operation. The appearances suggest that percutaneous extraction from the proximal
coronary sinus may be feasible but that difficulty may be encountered if the lead
tip is placed into the distal coronary veins.

First-trimester fetal heart block: a marker for cardiac anomaly.

Baschat AA(1), Gembruch U, Knöpfle G, Hansmann M.

Author information: 
(1)Center for Advanced Fetal Care, University of Maryland, Baltimore 21201-1703, 
USA.

BACKGROUND: Fetal heart block in the second and third trimesters may be caused by
transplacental passage of auto-antibodies or cardiac defects. Little is known
about the etiology of first-trimester fetal heart block.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fetal heart block was diagnosed in four patients (negative
antibody serology) referred for first-trimester sonographic evaluation of
increased fetal nuchal fold thickness with bradycardia. Two-dimensional
echocardiography was complemented by color Doppler flow imaging of the fetal
heart. Fetal arrhythmia was verified by M-mode, pulsed wave Doppler and/or color 
M-mode echocardiography.
RESULTS: All fetuses had congenital heart disease, atrioventricular valve
regurgitation, heart block and edema. Autopsy confirmed heterotaxy in three cases
(left atrial isomerism with atrial septal defect; left isomerism with
double-outlet right ventricle, great artery malposition and ventricular septal
defect. The third case had dextrocardia with atrioventricular canal defect and
the fourth case dextrocardia with great artery transposition.
CONCLUSION: First-trimester fetal bradycardia may result from heart block of the 
type associated with complex congenital heart disease. Accelerated edema
formation in this setting may be the basis of nuchal edema formation.
First-trimester fetal echocardiography offers the potential for early diagnosis
and intervention in these cases with poor prognosis.

Comment in

The best management of pacemaker lead related endocarditis is complete surgical
or percutaneous removal of the pacemaker system. Although the traditional
surgical approach is via median sternotomy, we present two cases in which the
lead and vegetations were removed using a video-assisted endoscopic technique
through a limited right submammary incision. In each case the patient was
supported by partial extracorporeal perfusion. Additional tricuspid valve repair 
and atrial septal defect closure was performed in one case. The postoperative
courses were uneventful, illustrating that, when compared to the conventional
open heart surgical approach, the less invasive approach can be a safe and
effective way to remove an infected foreign body from the right heart with
increased comfort, fast recovery, and a better cosmetic result.

This report is on a newborn with congenital complete av-block due to a maternal
collagenosis. The intravenous application of erythromycin produced premature
ventricular beats and non sustained ventricular tachycardias by prolongation of
the QT interval. After discontinuation of the erythromycin application, the
QT-interval normalised.CONCLUSION: In atrioventricular conduction disorders with 
severe bradycardia and prolongation of the QT interval, the application of
erythromycin--if unavoidable--should be managed by slow intravenous infusion and 
with permanent ECG monitoring.

children had myoclonic epilepsy, congenital deafness, a dystrophic pattern of the
macular pigment epithelium, incomplete right bundle branch block, and psychiatric
disorders appearing after fever episodes. Results of all laboratory
investigations including mitochondrial DNA analysis were normal. Despite the fact
that this condition resembles one reported by Latham and Munro in 1937, it is
possible that we might be reporting on a new autosomal recessive syndrome.

PROBLEM: Maternal anti-SSA(B) antibody crosses the placenta and causes fetal
myocarditis, congenital heart block (CHB), hydrops fetalis, and intrauterine
fetal death. The aim of this study was to evaluate corticosteroids' efficacy as a
treatment for CHB.
METHOD OF STUDY: One fetus with complete CHB and one fetus with incomplete CHB
due to anti-SSA(B) antibody received maternal prednisolone (PSL) and
dexamethasone (DEXA) treatments. Heart rate, cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), left
ventricular fractional shortening (FS), and preload index (PLI) were
longitudinally measured by serial fetal echocardiograms.
RESULTS: In the former case, after maternal PSL/DEXA administration, improvement 
of cardiohemodynamics, i.e., the reduction of PLI from 1.7 to 0.4, CTR from 70 to
52%, and FS from 63 to 54% were observed. In the latter case, second degree 2:1
block was converted to 3:2 block/sinus rhythm, resulting in the increase of the
fetal heart rate from 65 to 116 beats per minute (bpm).
CONCLUSIONS: We disclosed for the first time the beneficial effects of
corticosteroids in the fetal cardiohemodynamics and conduction system of affected
fetuses with the presence of maternal anti-SSA(B) antibodies.

OBJECTIVE: We studied familial cases of skeletal myopathy with atrial
fibrillation (Af) and atrioventricular (AV) block to compare the clinical
features to other myopathies associated with cardiac abnormalities.
METHODS: Neurologic, cardiologic, electrophysiologic, muscle pathology, and
genetic studies were performed on the patients showing muscle weakness.
PATIENTS: Four patients (a 63-year-old mother, 30 and 32-year-old sisters, and
their maternal grandmother) and three healthy family members from three
generations were studied. The mode of inheritance was suspected as autosomal
dominant.
RESULTS: Two sisters with congenital myopathy without rigid spine developed Af
and AV block at the age of 28 and 18, respectively. The mother showed AV block,
and underwent pacemaker implantation at the age of 63. The maternal grandmother
had dilated cardiomyopathy, Af and severe lordosis. She died of stroke attacks
and congestive heart failure at the age of 78. Muscle biopsy obtained from the
mother and sisters showed myopathic changes without characteristic abnormalities.
No mitochondrial DNA mutations were found. Other inherited myopathies with
cardiac complications were not suspected in this family.
CONCLUSION: This Japanese family appears to belong to a new genetically
heterogeneous group of autosomal dominant skeletal myopathy with severe AV block 
and Af.

Complete congenital heart block (CCHB) is a rare disease of the newborn that
carries significant morbidity and mortality. It generally occurs as a result of
the presence of maternal autoantibodies that are transferred to the fetus and
affect the fetal heart, or it may be associated with a congenital structural
abnormality of the heart. Infants with CCHB are at risk for diminished cardiac
output and the subsequent development of congestive heart failure. Many infants
require the placement of a cardiac pacemaker. It is essential that the nurse
caring for these infants have a good understanding of the disease process and be 
familiar with the unique problems that these infants and their families may
encounter.

Comment in

We present the case of a nine-year-old boy afflicted with Ondine's curse, who
developed complete atrioventricular heart block after a single bolus of propofol 
for induction of anaesthesia for strabismus surgery. Ondine's curse, the other
name for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, is characterized by a
generalized disorder of autonomic function. Propofol has no effect on the normal 
atrioventricular conduction system in humans but it reduces sympathetic activity 
and can highly potentiate other vagal stimulation factors. Heart block has been
documented after propofol bolus use in adults but, to our knowledge, not in
children. It would appear that propofol is not a good choice for anaesthesia in
congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.

Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (sometimes referred to as 'spongy
myocardium') is believed to represent an arrest in endomyocardial morphogenesis. 
The gross anatomical appearance is characterized by numerous excessively
prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses. Distinct
morphological features can be diagnosed on two-dimensional echocardiography. We
present here a family of isolated noncompaction of the left ventricular
myocardium, in which 5 affected individuals suggested the presence of some
genetic abnormalities in this disorder.

We present a case of pacer wire thrombus and recurrent pulmonary emboli in
pregnancy associated with a permanent pacemaker. Transthoracic echocardiography
demonstrated a thrombus attached to the pacer wire at the point where it crossed 
the tricuspid valve. After the uncomplicated vaginal delivery, thrombolytic
therapy was given. This thrombus persisted despite thrombolytic therapy.
Consequently, the patient was referred for cardiac surgery. The suspected cause
was confirmed during the surgery.

An infant presented with neonatal syncope and seizures. An ECG showed a
preexcitation pattern, most compatible with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.
Rhythm monitoring during an event demonstrated prolonged periods of complete AV
block with no ventricular escape mechanism. We postulated that ventricular
asystole was initiated by mechanical or autonomic influences on the accessory
pathway and sustained by electrophysiologic interactions between the accessory
pathway and the junctional escape focus. This is the first case report of a
newborn having coexisting congenital AV block and WPW syndrome.

Role of fetal echocardiography in the management of isolated fetal heart block

(1)Division of Pediatric Cardiology and Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Saint Louis
University School of Medicine, Missouri 63104, USA.

Persistent bradycardia is an uncommon cardiac problem in fetuses but carries a
high mortality in those with a ventricular rate <55 bpm. Fetal heart block is one
of the most common causes of persistent fetal bradycardia (PFB). An optimal
method for assessing and monitoring cardiovascular compensation in the setting of
PFB due to heart block has not been fully established. We report the application 
of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in close monitoring of cardiac
function and hemodynamics in a third-trimester fetus with a ventricular rate <55 
bpm due to heart block, which assisted in successful management of the pregnancy 
to term. Hemodynamic and cardiac adaptive changes in compromised fetuses,
particularly due to heart block, are discussed.

[Congenital atrioventricular block].

[Article in French]

Grolleau R(1), Leclercq F, Guillaumont S, Voisin M.

Author information: 
(1)Service de cardiologie A, Hôpital Arnaud-de-Villeneuve, Montpellier.

Congenital atrioventricular block is defined (Yater) as a documented conduction
defect in a young subject with unquestionable bradycardia in the absence of a
history of infection which might have caused the condition after birth. It is a
rare condition (1 out of 20,000 births) and may be isolated or associated with
another congenital malformation. Four cardiac malformations are classically
associated: endomyocardial fibrosis, morphological abnormalities close to the
conduction system: corrected transposition, left isomerism; patent ductus
arteriosus and atrial septal defect apparently unrelated but the most common; the
association of mitral regurgitation in adults, although the significance is not
very clear. Isolated block is often observed in patients with mothers suffering
from autoimmune disease, often clinically latent. Anti Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B
antibodies cross into the foetal circulation and cause inflammation of the
conduction tissues but the causal mechanism is not known. The diagnosis of the
conduction defect is sometimes made during foetal life by echocardiography. After
birth, the diagnosis is made by electrocardiography but the block is not always
complete or permanent, its degree often increasing with time. In addition, in
advanced degrees of block, the escape rhythm tends to slow down. Long-term
follow-up studies have revised the previously considered good prognosis of
isolated congenital atrioventricular block but advances in cardiac pacing provide
satisfactory treatment. In the foetus, isolated atrioventricular block is usually
associated with an escape rhythm > 60/min and enables normal vaginal delivery; a 
low heart rate < 55/min and anasarca carry a poor prognosis. In the neonate,
pacing is indicated in babies with cardiac failure and a heart rate < 55/min.
Follow-up by Holter monitoring, exercise testing and echocardiography is
justified in children and adolescents; the patients may become symptomatic at any
age. Pacing is essential in symptomatic cases (malaise, ventricular dysfunction) 
and useful in cases with long QT intervals, frequent ventricular extrasystoles
and wide ventriculogrammes. Pacing is not always easy in children. Epicardial
pacing by thoracotomy or an epigastric approach is possible but endocavitary
pacing is to be preferred using thin pacing catheters introduced via the
subclavian vein and small pacemakers implanted in a sub or prepectoral site. A
pacing mode which restores the normal atrioventricular sequence is theoretically 
superior to single ventricular pacing even if rate responsive frequency.

Sudden death in an adult with a small ventricular septal defect and an aneurysmal

An apparently healthy man of 26 years of age suddenly died. He was known to have 
had a small ventricular septal defect and complete right bundle branch block from
early childhood. At post-mortem examination the small ventricular septal defect
was found associated with an aneurysm of the membranous septum. Histological
examination showed a normal atrioventricular node and bundle, adjacent to the
aneurysm. There was fibrous interruption at the commencement of the right bundle 
branch, which was considered the basis of the bundle branch block. It was also
considered that the right bundle branch block was of the hereditary type and that
this, rather than the aneurysm of the membranous septum, was responsible for the 
unexpected death.

Junctional ectopic tachycardia evolving into complete heart block.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cardiology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht,
Netherlands.

Transition from congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia to complete AV block
was observed in an 8 month old girl, over a 36 hour period, during initial
hospital admission. Two years later she had evidence of a rapidly increasing left
ventricular end diastolic diameter, associated with lowest heart rates during
sleep of < 30 beats/min. A transvenous permanent pacemaker was therefore
implanted. This finding supports the idea that a pathological process in the area
of the AV junction, initially presenting as junctional ectopic tachycardia may
later extend to sudden complete atrioventricular block.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Genetics, Gülhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara.

Holt-Oram syndrome is a distinct autosomal dominant entity presenting with upper 
limb defects and cardiac abnormality. No correlation between the severity of the 
heart and the limb defects has been established. Here we report variable clinical
expression of Holt-Oram syndrome in three generations. The grandfather presented 
with typical upper limb defects: phocomelia of arms with three digits on each
hand, congenital heart defect and narrow shoulders. His son manifested cardiac
conduction disturbance with no congenital heart or skeletal defect. The
granddaughter showed ventricular septal defect and moderate radial deviations of 
both hands with no obvious hypoplasia of the extremities. Clinical data of the
presented family suggests lack of penetrance with respect to skeletal and
structural cardiac abnormalities in the Holt-Oram syndrome.

INTRODUCTION: Conduction abnormalities associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS)
have been reported as "pseudo 2:1 AV block" due to sinus intervals shorter than
ventricular refractoriness.
METHOD AND RESULTS: We report the electrophysiologic characteristics of a patient
suffering from congenital LQTS with episodes of true 2:1 AV block. Induction of
2:1 infra-Hisian blocks and return to 1:1 conduction were observed using single
atrial and ventricular extrastimuli. The block was located in the Purkinje
network but not in the myocardium.
CONCLUSION: The His-Purkinje system of our LQTS patient displayed dynamic
properties with a strong increase in refractoriness for short-long sequences and 
a decrease for long-short sequences that triggered intermittent 2:1 AV blocks.

1:1 atrioventricular conduction in congenital complete heart block.

Author information:

A female neonate with congenital complete heart block developed atrioventricular 
conduction through an accessory pathway. Despite sinus rhythm and an adequate
heart rate she developed severe dilated cardiomyopathy and died at age 14 months.
This case illustrates that underlying heart block can be present in individuals
with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and that the dilated
cardiomyopathy that occasionally accompanies autoimmune congenital heart block is
not primarily caused by bradycardia.

Congenital conduction defects in children born to asymptomatic mothers with
anti-SSA/SSB antibodies: report of two cases.

It is very difficult to identify pregnant asymptomatic mothers carrying
anti-SSA/SSB antibodies. We report two cases of neonatal lupus erythematosus,
born to asymptomatic mothers with anti-SSA/Ro antibody, who developed isolated
complete congenital cardiac heart block and transient second degree conduction
defect associated with cardiac abnormalities, respectively. The first died
suddenly of acute myocarditis at the age of 20 months, while the second underwent
surgery at the age of 10 years for a ventricular septal defect, after two
episodes of second degree atrioventricular block in infancy. We believe that in
both cases the diagnosis could have been made in utero after correct heart beat
analysis. We propose careful monitoring of fetal heart beat in all pregnant
mothers. The occurrence of heart beat modification should prompt clinicians to
test the mother for antibody positivity. This approach may permit early diagnosis
and in utero treatment in order to spare the child from cardiac conduction
defects. We provide the evidence of these cases and propose a flow chart for all 
physicians dealing with pregnancy.

HISTORY AND ADMISSION FINDINGS: A 36-year-old man reported feeling generally
unwell and experiencing shooting and tearing pain, especially in the thighs and
over the precordium, just after returning from a five-week holiday in Central
Africa. An active sportsman in his youth (fencing) he was known to have
incomplete right bundle branch block in the ECG and a raised concentration of
gamma-glutamyl transferase, of unknown aetiology. Physical examination on
admission was negative except for discrete weakness on head bending and slightly 
delayed finger stretching after making a fist.
INVESTIGATIONS: Multiple tests excluded tropical diseases. There were abnormal T 
waves in leads III and V1 of the ECG. Serum concentrations of creatine kinase
(CK; maximally 822 U/l), gamma-glutamyl transaminase (gamma-GT; 446 U/l),
glutamyl-pyruvate transaminase (GPT; 510 U/l) and of glutamate-oxalate
transaminase (GOT; 108 U/l) were all elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein were within normal limits.
TREATMENT AND COURSE: At first the suspected diagnosis was myocarditis and he was
placed on bed-rest, monitored and treated symptomatically. Because the levels of 
CK, gamma-GT, GPT and GOT improved only transiently, there were no signs of
inflammatory disease and the muscle pains continued, biopsies of skeletal muscle 
and the liver were done. They revealed nonspecific liver changes and a
noninflammatory myopathy. As congenital myopathy was suspected he was transferred
to the neurology department where the diagnosis of proximal myotonic myopathy
(PROMM) was established.
CONCLUSION: We assume that an unknown viral infection triggered the illness that,
in addition to the usual nonspecific symptoms, accentuated the signs of the
existing multi-system proximal myotonic myopathy.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare syndrome. It is characterized by a
transient lupus dermatitis and congenital heart block. The immunopathogenesis of 
the disease has been linked to the presence of the SSA antibody. In this report, 
we describe a symptomatic congenital heart block in a 13-year-old male whose
mother had documented systemic lupus erythematosus. We also discuss how to manage
a woman with lupus erythematosus and positive antiSSA/Ro antibodies. We conclude 
that patients with neonatal lupus and their mothers should be observed closely
before delivery and for prolonged periods for signs of active disease.

A new therapeutic approach to the fetus with congenital complete heart block:
preemptive, targeted therapy with dexamethasone.

Rosenthal D(1), Druzin M, Chin C, Dubin A.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Stanford University Medical School,
California 94304, USA.

BACKGROUND: Therapy of established congenital complete heart block in the fetus
has resulted in improved survival but persistence of heart block. This exposes
the infant to the morbidity of heart block, including the risk of sudden death
and pacemaker implantation.
CASE: A 35-year-old gravida 2, para 1, with Sjogren syndrome and a previous
pregnancy complicated by congenital complete heart block presented during her
second pregnancy. Intensive fetal monitoring with echocardiography was employed. 
Early evidence of myocardial dysfunction and dysrhythmia was found, dexamethasone
therapy was initiated, and the dysfunction and dysrhythmia resolved. The
pregnancy went to term without further complication.
CONCLUSION: This represents a new and successful strategy to identify very early 
signs of myocardial disease in a fetus at high risk of congenital complete heart 
block, enabling targeted, preemptive therapy.

Severe hypothyroidism in children is known to produce cardiac abnormalities such 
as asymmetric thickening or hypertrophy of the interventricular septum, smaller
internal dimensions of the left ventricle, a smaller left ventricular outflow
tract, and less systolic septal excursion. In this report, we present a
1.5-year-old boy who was admitted to our hospital because of growth retardation. 
According to the clinical and laboratory findings, congenital hypothyroidism,
dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP), atrioventricular complete heart block and secundum

Perinatal management of congenital complete atrioventricular block: report of
nine cases.

Fukushige J(1), Takahashi N, Igarashi H, Nakayama H, Inoue K, Hijii T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka,
Japan.

BACKGROUND: The addition of fetal ultrasonography has allowed the prenatal
diagnosis and observation of congenital complete atrioventricular block (CCAVB). 
Thus, the management of the affected fetuses should be modified accordingly.
METHODS: The medical records were reviewed to identify patients with CCAVB, and
clinical and laboratory data were collected.
RESULTS: Nine patients with CCAVB, diagnosed prenatally, were identified. The
gestational age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 18 to 38 weeks (median, 25
weeks). The gestational age and birthweight ranged from 29 to 41 weeks and from
1420 to 4075 g, respectively. An accompanying congenital cardiac anomaly was
noted in three cases, including one with polysplenia syndrome. The heart rate at 
birth ranged from 30 to 80 bpm. In three neonates, isoproterenol was given for
bradycardia. One fetus with hydrops fetalis associated with complex heart disease
was treated with maternally administered digoxin, with resolution of the fluid
accumulation. A permanent pacemaker was implanted in six cases: two within 1 day 
of birth; two during the neonatal period; one at 51 days; and the other at 2
years and 11 months of age. There were no deaths or major complications and all
have remained well beyond their infancy.
CONCLUSIONS: With the improvement of diagnostic methodology, more cases with
CCAVB, including those with complex heart disease, could be diagnosed during
fetal life. Their outcome has been steadily improving with the advances in
perinatal management, pacemakers and implant techniques, irrespective of
associated structural cardiac defects.

A 21 week fetus was diagnosed with complete heart block. From the first diagnosis
until 38 weeks gestation, umbilical venous pulsations occurred during ventricular
systole. The ventricular frequency was 49 bpm. The venous pulsations corresponded
with the ventricular frequency. At 38 weeks venous pulsations also occurred
during ventricular diastole. Umbilical pulsations during diastole were associated
with a decrease of ventricular frequency to 28 bpm and fetal hydrops. The venous 
pulsations during ventricular systole seem to be characteristic of complete heart
block. The pulsations during ventricular diastole reflect the fetal heart
failure. Doppler ultrasound aids in the diagnosis and surveillance of the fetus
with complete heart block.

An association between complete congenital heart block (CCHB) and anti-Ro/SSA
antibody is well recognized but has never been reported in Thailand. We report
here a 37-year-old female who was admitted because of massive epistaxis secondary
to immune thrombocytopenia. She had given birth to a child with CCHB 2 years
previously, when she was healthy. Antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro/SSA were
positive in her sera, but were negative in her son. The relationship between
anti-Ro/SSA antibody and outcome of mothers with infants with CCHB is reviewed.

Geriatria, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Anomalous origin of coronary arteries (AOCA) is a rare congenital
disease. Although it may have a benign course, it has been identified as a
frequent cause of sports-related sudden death. Unfortunately, in vivo detection
of AOCA is not easy, as individuals with this anomaly often are asymptomatic and 
show no signs of myocardial ischemia. Presently, transthoracic two-dimensional
echocardiography (TTE) is the only noninvasive, widely available tool to
visualize the ostia and first tracts of coronary arteries.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of TTE in the screening of AOCA in a large
athletic population.
STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective study, we assessed the ostia and first tracts of
coronary arteries in 3,650 subjects (mean age, 30+/-12 years) practicing
different sports at various competitive levels. Subjects underwent a TTE
examination in our laboratory for scientific or diagnostic purposes.
RESULTS: Technically satisfactory echocardiograms were obtained in 3,504 subjects
(96%); a clear visualization of the ostia and first tracts of both coronary
arteries was obtained in 3,150 cases (90%). Three asymptomatic athletes (0.09%)
were suspected to have an AOCA; two with a right coronary artery origin from the 
left sinus, and one with a left coronary artery origin from the right sinus.
Diagnosis was confirmed by coronary angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that AOCA is rare in asymptomatic athletes.
Systematic and accurate exploration of coronary anatomy in athletes referred for 
a diagnostic TTE examination may be useful in identifying those with AOCA.

Isolated congenitally complete heart block attributable to combined
nodoventricular and intraventricular discontinuity.

Chow LT(1), Cook AC, Ho SY, Leung MP, Anderson RH.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital,
Shatin, Hong Kong.

Intraventricular together with atrial-axis and nodoventricular discontinuity, in 
which various parts of the conduction system are replaced by fibrous or fatty
tissue, constitute the three major pathological categories of isolated
congenitally complete heart block. Intraventricular discontinuity is distinctly
rare, with only two previous cases reported in the literature, one of which was
associated with a familial history of heart block. The cardiac conduction systems
of two cases of isolated congenitally complete heart block were serially
sectioned and analyzed histopathologically. The findings were correlated with the
clinical features, in particular, the family histories and maternal serum anti-Ro
antibodies. Both cases, a 9-day-old neonate and an 8-year-old schoolgirl, showed 
a combination of nodoventricular and intraventricular discontinuity, with absence
of the atrioventricular penetrating bundle, the entire right, and the proximal
portion of the left bundle branch. The branching bundle was absent in the first
case and replaced by fatty tissue in the second. In contrast to the commoner
atrial-axis discontinuity in which the atrioventricular node itself is usually
replaced by fibrous or fatty tissue with variable involvement distally, the sinus
node, and in particular, the atrioventricular node were normal in both of our
cases. There was no family history in either case, whereas tests for the maternal
serum anti-Ro antibody were positive in the first but negative in the second
case. Intraventricular discontinuity as a cause of isolated congenitally complete
heart block is very rare. In our cases, it co-existed with nodoventricular
discontinuity. It can be sporadic, familial, or associated with positive maternal
serum anti-Ro antibodies.

Stokes-Adams attacks are fairly common in children with congenital complete heart
block, but the occurrence of cerebral infarction is quite unusual. We present the
case of a 13-year-old boy with congenital heart block and an embolic stroke
involving the cerebral artery. Echocardiography revealed no valvular
regurgitation, hypokinetic segments, mural thrombus, or myxoma.
Electrocardiographic monitoring demonstrated good response of ventricular rate to
exercise and no episodes of atrial or ventricular dysrhythmia. It is assumed that
embolism occurred due to bradycardia.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block is a rare entity. The association
between this disease, maternal connective tissue disease and maternal antibodies 
[anti-Ro (SS-A) resp. anti-La (SS B)] is well known. Diagnosis can be made by
means of fetal Doppler-echocardiography by the 16th week of gestation. In our
case diagnosis was established in the 21st week of gestation. Ventricular rate
was 55/min, atrial rate 70/min. There were no signs of fetal hydrops. There were 
no signs of maternal connective tissue disease, but anti-Ro and anti-La
antibodies could be detected. The mother was treated with steroids from the time 
of diagnosis until the end of pregnancy. Altogether 9 Doppler-echocardiographic
studies were performed. A recurrence of normal rhythm did not occur. A slow but
continuous decrease of atrial and ventricular rate was observed. Interestingly,
there was no development of fetal hydrops until the very end of pregnancy when
the fetal heart rate reached a low of 28 beats per minute. We speculate, that the
therapy with steroids might have played an important role in the prevention of
early hydrops. At the onset of fetal hydrops delivery should be considered. In
symptomatic complete atrioventricular block we prefer the implantation of a
permanent pacemaker system immediately after birth. Efficient care for the fetus 
resp. the newborn can only be achieved through well planned cooperation.

Congenital complete heart block and successful vaginal delivery.

Sherman SJ(1), Featherstone LS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, St. John Hospital and Medical Center,
Detroit, Mich. 48236, USA.

BACKGROUND: Congenital complete heart block is an uncommon fetal arrhythmia
characterized by complete dissociation of the atrial and ventricular
contractions.
CASES: Two patients were diagnosed with isolated congenital complete heart block 
in the second trimester of pregnancy. Successful vaginal delivery was achieved by
both.
CONCLUSION: A monitoring protocol algorithm to be used by the clinician in
managing term patients with isolated complete congenital heart block is
presented. Vaginal delivery can be safely accomplished in patients with isolated 
congenital complete heart block, with the use of ultrasound and fetal scalp blood
sampling to assess fetal well-being during labor and delivery.

We report a case of congenital complete heart block (CCHB). A 38-year-old woman
was admitted our hospital because of fetal bradycardia at 21 weeks 3 days of
gestational age. She had no symptom of collagen disease. On admission, laboratory
data showed positive anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies and anti-52
kD SS-A/Ro antibodies. But anti-60 kD SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La antibodies were
negative. Consequently anti-52 kD SS-A/Ro antibodies positive woman had an infant
with CCHB. The baby was equipped with pacemaker at the age of 2 months. This
report suggests that anti-52 kD SS-A/Ro antibodies may play an important role in 
the development of CCHB.

Use of an atrial loop to extend the duration of endocardial pacing in a neonate.

Rosenthal E(1), Bostock J.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Guy's Hospital, London, UK.

Use of an atrial loop has been proposed as a means of extending the longevity of 
endocardial pacing systems in small children who require ventricular pacing. A
few reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method at reducing the
number of interventions in infants and small children, but there is little
reported experience in neonates. Permanent endocardial ventricular demand pacing 
was performed in a 3.4-kg neonate. The generator was placed in a prepectoral
pocket and a redundant loop of lead was left in the atrium to cater for further
growth. At 32 months he weighs 13.6 kg and the loop has uncoiled leaving
additional lead slack for further growth.

A 0-day-old infant with symptomatic congenital atrioventricular block diagnosed
by fetal echocardiography was successfully treated with the pacemaker
implantation. Two steroid-eluting myocardial electrodes were fixed on the wall of
the right ventricle. Steroid-eluting myocardial electrode is smaller than the
others, stab-in and screw-in leads, so even in neonate we were able to place the 
leads by the subxyphoid approach. The postoperative thresholds were excellent.

Physiologically corrected transposition of the great arteries (cTGA), defined by 
discordant atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, is an uncommon
congenital cardiac malformation. It rarely exists without associated cardiac
anomalies, the most common of which are ventricular septal defect, pulmonary
outflow obstruction, tricuspid valve (systemic) deformity, and rhythm
disturbances. Conversely, hypoplasia of the systemic ventricle and systemic
inflow or outflow obstructions have seldom been reported, although their
recognition may significantly influence surgical repair and the patient's
prognosis. We report a case of cTGA with complete heart block, moderate
hypoplasia of the systemic ventricle, and severe aortic coarctation that was
echocardiographically diagnosed in utero at 30 weeks' gestation because of fetal 
growth retardation and persistent fetal bradycardia. After delivery the patient
underwent epimyocardial pacemaker implantation and aortic coarctation repair at 2
weeks of age. Unfortunately, the patient died on the seventh postoperative day
because of systemic ventricular hypertrophy. Although it is well known that fetal
echocardiography may reliably diagnose uncommon congenital cardiac malformations,
to the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first reported case of
antenatal diagnosis of this complex anomaly.

The management of the preterm fetus with hydrops due to complete congenital heart
block is difficult. The outcome is frequently associated with significant
morbidity and mortality. Two fetuses presented at the post menstrual age of 29
and 30 weeks respectively with severe hydrops due to complete heart block. The
following staged approach was adopted: (1) enhance fetal lung maturation with
maternal corticosteroids and thyroid releasing hormone for 48 h; (2) elective
Caesarean section; (3) classical neonatal management consisting of intubation and
ventilation, drainage of all cavities with effusions; (4) increase neonatal heart
rate by administration of i.v. isoprenaline, by bipolar trans-oesophageal pacing 
or epicutaneo-oesophageal pacing; (5) after the regression of the hydrops, start 
epicardial pacing after implantation of 2 or 3 temporary epicardial 3/0
pacemaker; (6) implantation of a permanent abdominal pacing system with steroid
epicardial tip once the threshold exceeds 20 mA or when the baby weighs more than
1500 g. In these patients a permanent pacing system was implanted at the ages of 
8 weeks (2045 g) and 4 weeks (1560 g) respectively. No major complications
occurred; the cardiac outcome with 37 and 34 months of follow up is
excellent.CONCLUSION: This proposed staged approach with temporary epicardial
leads can improve the outcome of hydropic fetuses due to complete congenital AV
block.

Drowning of a girl with anomaly of the bundle of His and the right bundle branch.

Stumpp JW(1), Schneider J, Bär W.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Legal Medicine, University of Zürich, Switzerland.

We report an unusual case of a 17-year-old girl who died in an filled bathtub.
There were at least two attacks of unconsciousness in her premortem history. In
April 1994, electrocardiography had shown an incomplete right bundle branch
block. At autopsy, unspecific signs of drowning and hypoplasia of the terminal
part of the atrioventricular bundle of His and the right bundle branch within the
cardiac conduction system were found. There were no other obvious autopsy
findings related to the sudden death of this girl. In addition, toxicologic
examination for illegal drugs and alcohol was completely negative. We conclude
that this might be a rare case of death because of acute decompensation of a
partial hypoplastic cardiac conduction system with loss of consciousness and
consequent drowning in the bathtub. This case illustrates the value of an
extensive pathologic examination of the cardiac conduction system in unexpected
death of young people.

We report the case of a patient with complete heart block caused by extension of 
a congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva into the upper interventricular
septum, which was diagnosed by transthoracic and transesophageal
echocardiography. We emphasize the rarity of this pathology and the value of
transesophageal echocardiography in its assessment, providing a complete
anatomicofunctional characterization and allowing surgical repair without
previous cardiac catheterization.

An 80-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of recurrent syncope
caused by sick sinus syndrome. Conventional transthoracic echocardiography showed
a membranelike echo-dense structure across the left atrium. Subsequently we
confirmed the diagnosis of cor triatriatum with multiple defects and shunt flows 
across the membrane by transesophageal color flow Doppler echocardiography. There
were no other associated congenital anomalies. The patient recovered well and was
discharged from the hospital after implantation of a permanent VVI pacemaker for 
sinus node dysfunction. No other cardiac intervention for the cor triatriatum was
done except follow-up with echocardiography. About 1 year after discharge, he
died of massive cerebral infarction. The cardiac autopsy findings were compatible
with the transesophageal echocardiogram. This is a rare case of uncorrected cor
triatriatum in an elderly patient.

Monozygotic twins discordant for congenital complete heart block.

Cooley HM(1), Keech CL, Melny BJ, Menahem S, Morahan G, Kay TW.

Author information: 
(1)Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: Isolated congenital complete heart block (CCHB) occurs in 1/20,000
live births. More than 85% of mothers giving birth to affected infants are
anti-Ro antibody positive, but only approximately 1% of babies with
anti-Ro-positive mothers develop CCHB. We studied 2 sets of monozygotic twins
discordant for CCHB.
METHODS: Monozygosity was determined using placental examination and DNA
microsatellite analysis. HLA typing was performed. Autoantibody studies were
performed using counterimmunoelectrophoresis, immunoblotting, Ro 52 and Ro 60
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) 
on Ro 60- and Ro 52-transfected HEp-2 cells.
RESULTS: Both sets of twins were monozygotic. They had similar birth weights.
Twin 2 in the second set required a pacemaker at age 2 months. Both mothers were 
positive for anti-Ro 52 and anti-Ro 60 antibody, and neither had anti-La antibody
on immunoblot. One set of twins was studied at birth. Similar titers of anti-Ro
52 and anti-Ro 60 antibody were found by IIF and ELISA.
CONCLUSION: There are no previous well-documented reports of monozygotic twins
discordant for CCHB. These cases demonstrate that there is still discordance in
the development of CCHB despite identical genetics and environmental exposure to 
anti-Ro antibody.

Fetal ventricular rate in case of congenital complete heart block is increased by
ritodrine. Case report.

Koike T(1), Minakami H, Shiraishi H, Sato I.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.

We encountered a case of fetal bradycardia (57 bpm) induced by heart block. The
continuous intravenous administration of ritodrine to a mother to treat fetal
brady-cardia at 28 weeks of gestation successfully increased the fetal
ventricular rate by 15 bpm (from 57 to 72 bpm). Pregnancy was continued for 10
weeks, and fetal cardiac failure did not occur. The fetal ventricular rate
gradually decreased to 52 bpm after discontinuation of the ritodrine infusion. It
is suggested that maternal administration of ritodrine can be considered in a
case of life-threatening fetal bradycardia induced by complete heart block.

Congenital complete heart block.

Agarwala B(1), Sheikh Z, Cibils LA.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, University of Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Congenital complete heart block in utero has become diagnosed more frequently
with the clinical use of fetal echocardiography. The fetus with complete heart
block may remain asymptomatic or may develop congestive heart failure. Congenital
complete heart block is more frequently seen in infants of mothers with systemic 
lupus erythematosus, both clinically manifested and subclinical systemic lupus
erythematosus with positive antibodies (SS-A and SS-B antibodies). At birth, the 
neonate with complete heart block may remain asymptomatic and may not require a
pacemaker to increase the heart rate. The indications for a pacemaker in neonates
with complete heart block have been discussed. Both in-utero and neonatal
management of congenital complete heart block are discussed to manage congestive 
heart failure in a fetus. Four patients with congenital complete heart block are 
presented covering a broad spectrum of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and
management both in the fetal and neonatal period.

[The cardiac and neurological manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in congenital
first-degree AV block].

[Article in German]

Stille-Siegener M(1), Eiffert H, Vonhof S.

Author information: 
(1)Abteilung für Kardiologie, Medizinische Klinik sowie Hygiene-Institut,
Universität Göttingen.

HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 19-year-old youth was hospitalised because of
sudden onset of incomplete lid closure and drooping mouth on the left. He
regularly walked through fields and woods; three weeks before admission he had
noted swelling and reddening on his neck, which he thought was due to an insect
bite. When 9 years old a functional heart murmur and 1 degree AV block (P-R
interval 0.25s) had been found. Physical examination showed peripheral facial
paresis and a 2/6 systolic murmur over the aortic area.
INVESTIGATIONS: As Borreliosis (Lyme disease) was suspected, relevant laboratory 
tests were performed. These revealed specific IgM antibodies against Borrelia
burgdorferi. Polymerase chain reaction demonstrated B. burgdorferi-specific DNA
in cerebrospinal fluid and urine. The ECG showed 1 degree AV block (P-R interval 
0.28s).
TREATMENT AND COURSE: Ceftriaxone was administered at once (4 g, followed by 2 g 
daily intravenously for 14 days). The P-R interval increased to maximally 0.31 s 
and transient incomplete right bundle branch block developed on the second day.
Long-term ECG monitoring also revealed ventricular arrhythmias (Lown IVb), but
they gradually disappeared. The neurological signs regressed completely within
five days of the start of treatment, while the P-R interval had returned to its
initial value of 0.25 s 3 months later.
CONCLUSION: The case makes clear that an ECG should be recorded in borreliosis
even in the absence of cardiac symptoms. Hospitalisation with long-term
monitoring becomes necessary if it is abnormal.

Author information: 
(1)Dermatology Clinic, Hospitais da Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is characterized by transient, annular
cutaneous lesions, congenital heart block, and a variety of systemic or
hematologic abnormalities. We describe a white infant girl with onset of skin
lesions on the face and scalp at 4 days of age. At age 4 weeks she had
generalized, erythematous, scaly, annular skin lesions that underwent spontaneous
regression at age 5 months. Her mother had no cutaneous or other lesions, but
complement examinations revealed the presence of anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB)
antibodies, and absence of anti-Sm and anti-RNP antibodies. Karyotyping revealed 
Turner syndrome (TS) with 45,XO sex chromosome constitution. Ro(SSA) and La(SSB) 
antibodies were found, and direct immunofluorescence testing on healthy skin was 
positive. At age 5 months, follow-up immunologic examination of the infant had
normal results but the mother still had anti-Ro(SSA) and anti-La(SSB) antibodies.
We believe that this is the first reported case of NLE in association with TS.

We report a case of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) with congenital heart
block and severe myocardial failure, which was followed from the 25th week of
gestation because of fetal bradycardia. The child was delivered at the 37th week 
of gestation by elective cesarean section because of echocardiographically
documented heart enlargement, pericardial effusion and moderate insufficiency of 
the mitral and tricuspid valves. In spite of immediate pacing, intubation and
supportive treatment, the newborn developed progressive heart failure.
Echocardiography showed endocarditis of the mitral valve and diffuse myocarditis.
The heart failure resolved under steroid treatment. Our experience supports the
early use of steroids in treating myocarditis due to NLE. Intrauterine steroid
treatment in the presence of fetal hydrops and congenital heart block is
discussed.

Carolina 27710, USA.

A 26-year-old man underwent an electrophysiological study for evaluation of a
history of congenital heart disease, presyncope, and wide complex tachycardia.
During the study the patient developed sustained atrial fibrillation with a rapid
ventricular response. A 17-year-old man with a history of sick sinus syndrome
developed sustained atrial fibrillation. Both patients failed four attempts at
external cardioversion with a maximum delivered energy of 360 J. Low energy
cardioversion was successful in both patients using biphasic waveforms and
internal transvenous defibrillation electrodes. Internal cardioversion using a
transvenous electrode system can be successful in patients with atrial
fibrillation refractory to external cardioversion.

Undersensing of the tiny QRS complexes that emerged after the isolation of the
right ventricle in a patient with ventricular tachycardia.

This article describes a patient who underwent right ventricular disconnection
for medically refractory ventricular tachycardia associated with arrhythmogenic
right ventricular dysplasia. After the operation there was no ventricular
tachycardia recurrence. Two years after the operation, he received a permanent
VVI pacemaker for the symptomatic second-degree AV block. Sensing function of the
pacemaker was normal for the normal QRS complexes, but the tiny QRS complexes
that appeared after the arrhythmia surgery were not sensed by the pacemaker and
therefore caused no problem.

Lead extraction in young patients with and without congenital heart disease using
the subclavian approach.

Friedman RA(1), Van Zandt H, Collins E, LeGras M, Perry J.

Author information: 
(1)Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA.

Pacemaker lead removal using interlocking stylets and dilator sheaths has greatly
reduced the need for major surgical intervention when lead extraction is
required. Previous reports have shown the utility of this method in older
patients, most of whom have anatomically normal hearts. The purpose of this study
is to report the results of this technique in young patients with and without
congenital heart disease. There were 13 patients (M:F = 7:6) aged 9-26 years
(median 13). Congenital heart disease was present in 8 of 13 patients. A total of
17 leads required removal; they had been implanted for 54 +/- 24 months (range
19-94). Leads were removed from the left subclavian vein (13) or right subclavian
vein (4) only. Seventeen of 18 leads were completely removed and one partially
retained in the left subclavian vein. New leads were implanted from the same vein
in 11 of 13 patients. Interlocking stylets and metal or flexible dilator sheaths 
were used in all cases except two. There was one surgical complication: a late
wound dehiscence, which was easily managed. No patient required a transfusion,
and there was no structural damage noted in any patient on the postoperative
echocardiogram. We conclude that lead removal using interlocking stylets and
dilator sheaths from the subclavian approach is an effective technique that can
be used in young patients, including those with congenital heart disease.

Direct fetal therapy for hydrops secondary to congenital atrioventricular heart
block.

Anandakumar C(1), Biswas A, Chew SS, Chia D, Wong YC, Ratnam SS.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National University of Singapore,
Singapore.

BACKGROUND: The outcome for the fetus with hydrops fetalis secondary to complete 
congenital heart block is almost uniformly poor. Transplacental fetal therapy
with inotropic drugs may be unreliable in the hydropic fetus. We describe our
experience of direct fetal therapy with digoxin and furosemide in three cases.
CASES: In the first two cases, fetal hydrops secondary to congenital heart block 
was detected at 33 and 31 weeks. Direct fetal therapy with digoxin and furosemide
was given and the mothers received digoxin concurrently. The neonates were born
normally at 35 weeks and 33 weeks; one required ventricular pacing, but both are 
currently alive and well. In the third case, fetal hydrops was detected at 24
weeks, when furosemide was used alone for direct fetal therapy. The mother
developed chorioamnionitis at 29 weeks and was delivered by cesarean; the infant 
died of cardiac failure after 48 hours.
CONCLUSION: Initial direct fetal therapy with digoxin and furosemide followed by 
transplacental treatment with digoxin and direct fetal therapy with diuretics
might improve the perinatal salvage of hydropic fetuses with congenital heart
block. Treatment must be individualized because development of infection and
preterm labor might defeat the objective.

Ventricular conduction defect in isolated noncompaction of the ventricular
myocardium.

P.O. Box 3050, Doha, Qatar.

A 9-month-old boy and 4-month-old girl presented with severe heart failure. The
electrocardiogram showed complete and "incomplete" left bundle branch block,
respectively. In both infants noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium was
diagnosed with two-dimensional echocardiography. These cases are thought to be
the first descriptions of the occurrence of left bundle branch block with
noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium. Noncompaction of the ventricular
myocardium should be added to the list of the causes for left bundle branch block
in children.

Apoptosis as a possible cause of gradual development of complete heart block and

University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77555-0129, USA.

Comment in
    Circulation. 1997 Oct 21;96(8):2735.

BACKGROUND: Gradually progressive development of complete heart block in young
people often is associated with cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death, but the
pathogenesis remains unexplained.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A young woman with complete heart block died suddenly. Her
mother had serological but no clinical evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome.
Five brothers of another family had arrhythmia and heart block. Three died
suddenly; the other two have automatic defibrillators and are alive. The hearts
from the young woman and two of the three brothers who died were available for
our histological examination of their cardiac conduction systems. In two of the
three hearts, the AV node was absent; in the third heart, only fragments of the
AV node remained. In all three hearts, the sinus node was nearly destroyed by a
noninflammatory degeneration with no abnormal fibrosis or infiltrate. In each
heart, the interatrial and internodal pathways were similarly involved, and in
the young woman, there were no myocardial cells in which these pathways normally 
exist.
CONCLUSIONS: In these three subjects with progressive development of complete
heart block and various arrhythmias, all of whom died suddenly, the histological 
abnormalities of their cardiac conduction systems are best interpreted as
resulting from apoptosis. Programmed cell death is a logical explanation for the 
pathogenesis of this puzzling clinical picture.

universitaire de Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada.

Congenital complete atrioventricular block is quite rare, with usually a benign
clinical evolution. However, because the first manifestation can be sudden death,
it is important to evaluate patients and to establish clear prognostic criteria. 
A case of complete congenital atrioventricular block in a 38-year-old woman is
presented to illustrate these criteria.

Therapeutic trial of sympathomimetics in three cases of complete heart block in
the fetus.

Groves AM(1), Allan LD, Rosenthal E.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Fetal Cardiology, Guy's Hospital, London, England.

BACKGROUND: A total of 36 fetuses with isolated congenital complete heart block
and structurally normal hearts have been seen in the department of fetal
echocardiography since 1980. Although the prognosis is good in the majority of
cases, those who develop intrauterine cardiac failure have a high mortality. The 
aim of this study was to investigate the contribution to management of
sympathomimetic therapy by comparing two possible agents administered to the
mothers.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of two sympathomimetic agents, isoprenaline and
salbutamol, was compared in three patients with isolated complete heart block.
Fetal heart rate and indexes of cardiac function were monitored during therapy.
Maternal cardiovascular status was also regularly assessed. Dosage of
isoprenaline increased from 1 to 12 micrograms/min, and salbutamol increased from
4 to 64 micrograms/min during the trial. No significant change was detected with 
isoprenaline therapy, but all fetuses showed an increase in heart rate and
improvement in ventricular function with salbutamol. Salbutamol was maintained
until delivery in one case with evidence of cardiac failure, with resolution of
fetal hydrops. All three delivered in good condition close to term. Two of three 
required pacing in the neonatal period.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that salbutamol can be effective in the treatment of
fetal complete heart block and should be considered in patients with this
condition where there is evidence of deteriorating cardiac function.

Comment in
    Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1996 Aug;175(2):502-3.

OBJECTIVE: Congenital complete heart block is associated with maternal
autoantibodies to Ro and La proteins, which injure the fetal cardiac conduction
system. We administered dexamethasone to the mothers of five fetuses with heart
block caused by maternal antibodies.
STUDY DESIGN: We diagnosed five cases of fetal heart block at 20 to 23 weeks and 
treated all mothers with dexamethasone 4 mg orally each day for the remainder of 
the pregnancy. All patients were positive for anti-SS-A (anti-Ro) and/or
anti-SS-B (anti-La) antibodies.
RESULTS: Four patients had complete heart block, and one had second-degree block.
In two patients (one with complete heart block, one with second-degree heart
block) the degree of block lessened with treatment. Hydrops in three complete
heart block patients resolved after treatment. Maternal antibody levels did not
change. Matched maternal and cord samples at delivery showed similar antibody
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Complete heart block can respond to transplacental glucocorticoid
therapy with improved cardiac conduction. Because there may be a concurrent
myocarditis, treatment in utero may also improve cardiac contractility, leading
to the observed rapid resolution of hydrops. Treatment with steroids that cross
the placenta should be considered for newly diagnosed cases of complete heart
block with positive antibody screens.

Superior vena caval syndrome (SVC) following transvenous pacemaker insertion is
an uncommon complication that has been treated with percutaneous transluminal
balloon angioplasty. We report a case of SVC syndrome following pacemaker
implantation that was treated with angioplasty. Several days after the initial
balloon dilation, the patient had recurrent symptoms and evidence of restenosis
on catheterization. Following repeat balloon dilation of this restenotic lesion, 
the patient had a favorable clinical response evidenced on hemodynamic and
angiographic follow-up at 6 months.

Provincial de Barcelona, Spain.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Single ventricle is a complex congenital cardiopathy
characterized by a unit ventricular chamber. Changes of the cardiovascular system
in response to epidural anesthesia in these patients have yet to be clearly
elucidated.
METHODS: A 26-year-old man with single ventricle underwent an orchiopexy under
lumbar epidural anesthesia with intravenous sedation.
RESULTS: Orchiopexy was successfully performed and the patient was discharged
from hospital 4 days later.
CONCLUSION: This case report emphasizes the issues of importance to
anesthesiologists in regard to this cardiopathy and describes a successful
technique of caring for a patient with a complex problem in an emergency
situation.

The advent of the pacemaker has opened a whole new dimension to management in
cardiology. Although its use has been well described in adults, its role in
paediatric cardiology has proven to be equally exciting and challenging. We
describe a case of a child with complex cyanotic heart disease who had an
insertion of a cardiac pacemaker via the transvenous route, one of the youngest
to be performed locally. This article also highlights the pertinent features of
paediatric pacemaker therapy, including its indications and implantation
technique.

Neonatal lupus syndrome (NLS) is characterized by the presence of cutaneous
lupus, congenital heart block or both associated with maternal autoantibodies
anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B). NLS is responsible for more than 80 percent of
cases with isolated congenital complete heart block. This report describes a
neonate with third-degree atrioventricular block who was born to an anti-Ro
(SS-A) positive mother. The dermatological and hematological manifestations of
NLS were absent. The infant's clinical condition was good during the two months

OBJECTIVE: To determine the serologic specificity of acid eluates from tissues of
a child who died with congenital complete heart block (CCHB).
METHODS: Tissues were extracted, acid eluted, and the IgG and antibody titers
determined on the eluates by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Antibodies to native 60-kd and denatured 52-kd Ro/SS-A were found to be 
enriched only in the heart eluate, and not in the eluates from brain, kidney, and
skin.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a major role for anti-native 60-kd Ro/SS-A in
the immunopathogenesis of CCHB.

Intrapartum fetal surveillance of congenital heart block with pulse oximetry.

van den Berg PP(1), Nijland R, van den Brand SF, Jongsma HW, Nijhuis JG.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The
Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: In cases of fetal congenital heart block, the fetal heart rate (FHR) 
pattern is uninterpretable, often leading to an operative delivery. Reflectance
pulse oximetry, a new technique that continuously measures the fetal arterial
oxygen saturation (SaO2) during labor, is potentially useful in intrapartum
monitoring of fetuses with this condition.
CASES: Two fetuses with congenital heart block were monitored with reflectance
pulse oximetry and fetal scalp blood sampling. The first patient delivered
spontaneously. Adequate signal quality was achieved during 73% of the study time.
Mean +/- standard deviation (SD) SaO2 was 53 +/- 14%. Fetal outcome was good. The
second patient was delivered by cesarean because of arrest of labor. Oxygen
saturation values were obtained during 89% of the study time. The mean SaO2 was
42 +/- 13%. There was a period of 8 minutes with SaO2 values below 20%. Capillary
blood pH dropped from 7.33 to 7.25; SaO2 values then returned to levels above 30%
and the capillary blood pH normalized. The neonate was born in good condition.
CONCLUSION: In fetal congenital heart block, adequate surveillance with FHR
monitoring during labor is not possible; therefore, continuous information on
fetal oxygenation may be valuable in assessing the fetal condition and may
prevent unnecessary obstetric interventions.

During her second pregnancy she was treated with prednisolone, azathioprine, and 
plasmapheresis, and levels of anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies fell
significantly. The pregnancy evolved uneventfully and resulted in the birth of an
unaffected male infant. This is the fourth reported case of a successful outcome

Complete congenital heart block in autoimmune hepatitis (SLA-positive).

Author information: 
(1)I. Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz,
Germany.

Complete congenital heart block is a serious complication of neonatal lupus
erythematosus which most often occurs in children of mothers suffering from
connective tissue disease. We report the occurrence of complete congenital heart 
block associated with autoimmune hepatitis (SLA-positive). A 32-year-old woman
was treated for more than 10 years for autoimmune hepatitis (SLA-/ANA-positive)
and remained in clinical remission under immunosuppressive therapy. She showed an
MHC-haplotype typical for autoimmune hepatitis (A1, B8, DR3). After a normal
first pregnancy, an emergency caesarean section was performed in the 32nd week of
her second pregnancy because of fetal bradycardia. The child died a few hours
after delivery of complete congenital AV-block. Retrospective analysis of the
maternal serum showed the emergence of SS-A/Ro-antibodies prior to the second
pregnancy. The maternal serum antibodies were reactive with the 52 kD
SS-A/Ro-antigen, as demonstrated by immunoblot employing recombinant
SSA/Ro-antigen. The occurrence of complete congenital heart block has been shown 
to be associated with the presence of SS-A/Ro antibodies as well as the
MHC-haplotype DR3. With respect to this genetic linkage, pregnant patients with
autoimmune hepatitis and the MHC-haplotype DR3 should be examined for the
presence of SS-A/Ro-antibodies. They should be closely followed during pregnancy 
to enable early detection of the development of congenital heart block, as
prevention by plasmapheresis plus dexamethasone may be possible at an early
stage.

A Ro/SS-A auto-antibody positive mother's infant revealed congenital complete
atrioventricular block, followed by insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and
multiple organ failure.

Fukazawa R(1), Seki T, Kamisago M, Watanabe M, Ogawa S, Yuge K, Hirayama T.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.

We experienced a congenital complete atrioventricular block infant who was born
from a Ro/SS-A antibody positive mother. Ro/SS-A antibody was also found in this 
baby which was presumed to be mediated by the maternal placenta. Temporary
cardiac pacing was required at birth and pacemaker implantation was performed at 
9 months. At 11 months of age, the baby fell into shock and experienced multiple 
organ failure because of diabetes mellitus-induced coma. The association between 
congenital complete heart block and the Ro/SS-A antibody is well known. However, 
the accompaniment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has not been reported
previously. As the Ro/SS-A antigen appears in the cytoplasm of many tissues, the 
possibility of an association between Ro/SS-A antibody and diabetes mellitus is
difficult to deny. We report this rare case to draw attention to the possibility 
that babies who are born from an Ro/SS-A antibody positive mother may develop
diabetes mellitus as well as congenital complete heart block.

[Sinus node dysfunction in children without heart defect].

[Article in German]

Oberhoffer R(1), von Bernuth G, Lang D, Gildein HP, Weismüller P.

Author information: 
(1)Pädiatrische Kardiologie, Universitäts-Kinderkliniken Ulm.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) is a rare cause of bradycardia in children without
structural heart disease. The clinical and diagnostic findings in 4 children with
this condition are described. Two of them presented with symptoms, in one
arrhythmias had been noted before birth, and a routine physical examination had
revealed bradycardia in another. Age at onset of either clinical symptoms or
bradycardia ranged from 0 to 11 1/2 years. Routine and 24-h-electrocardiograms
showed atrioventricular junctional rhythms with minimal rates of 25/min and
episodes of asystole with a maximal duration of 10.3 s. Other
electrocardiographic abnormalities such as first degree atrioventricular block,
ventricular extrasystoles or tachycardia were common findings.
Electrophysiological studies were performed in 3 cases and confirmed the
diagnosis of SND. A permanent pacemaker was inserted in 2 children; medical
treatment did not have any long-term effect. During a follow-up period of 5 to 13
years there were no complications. In summary, SND in childhood can be assessed
by Holter monitoring with high reliability. Electrophysiological studies are not 
necessary and of limited value. Therapeutic policies and prognostic statements
are difficult to establish due to the small number of cases so far described.
Permanent cardiac pacing, however, is unavoidable in symptomatic children.

Fetal cardiovascular hemodynamics in the presence of complete atrioventricular
block.

Veille JC(1), Covitz W.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bowman Gray School of Medicine of
Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC 27157.

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to follow serially the hemodynamic adaptation to a
congenital complete heart block in a human fetus.
STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal and serial M-mode and Doppler echocardiography over a 
10-week span were performed on a fetus affected by complete heart block.
Ventricular fractional shortening, size, and flow across the atrioventricualr
valves and outflow tracts were determined starting at 20 weeks up to the time of 
delivery. Neonatal Doppler follow-up was performed at 2 days of life after
implantation of a temporary pacemaker.
RESULTS: The right and left ventricles were able to adapt to sustained
bradycardia by increasing their size. This ventricular dilatation was also
associated with an increase in fractional shortening, which was associated with
ventricualr free wall hypertrophy. When ventricualr heart rate decreased to 38
beats/min, fractional shortening decreased, this was associated with the rapid
onset of ascites and pericardial effusion.
CONCLUSION: In the presence of sustained bradycardia ventricular output can
increase, because this fetus was able to increase ventricular size and fractional
shortening and wall thickness.

During VT in two cases with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia,
entrainment criteria, constant fusion beats except for the last entrainment beat,
progressive fusion, and a localized conduction block associated with interruption
of VT, were demonstrated with rapid ventricular pacing performed during VT.
Furthermore, a long conduction interval was present during entrainment from the
pacing site to the earliest activation site during VT, indicating the presence of
a slow conduction area. VT in these cases was, thus, due to reentry with an area 
of slow conduction within the circuit.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus: dissolution of atrioventricular block after
administration of corticosteroid to the pregnant mother.

Kawagoe, Japan.

Histopathologic and immunofluorescence findings of facial annular erythema on a
3-month-old female child, as well as serological detection of anti-SS-A (Ro) and 
anti-SS-B (La) antibodies, led to the diagnosis of neonatal lupus erythematosus
(LE), while no sign of abnormality in the conducting system of the heart was
found. During the pregnancy of the present child her mother, with positive
anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B antibodies, had a history of Sweet's syndrome. She was
treated with corticosteroid, resulting in a gradual diminution of the existing
complete atrioventricular block of the fetus. This history may implicate a
potential therapeutic effect for the congenital heart block associated with
neonatal LE of corticosteroid given to the pregnant mother.

South Wales, Australia.

This report describes a patient with neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) in whom
there was multisystem involvement including neonatal hepatitis. The hepatitis,
defined pathologically as a giant cell hepatitis, presented with severe
cholestasis, was unrelated to other known causes of neonatal hepatitis and
resolved spontaneously by 6 months of age. Both mother and infant were positive
for Sjögren syndrome A+B antibodies (SS-A[Ro] and SS-B[La]) as well as having
high titres of antinuclear antibody (ANA). Three of the four cases described in
the one previous report of this association were also ANA positive. This antibody
may be a marker for the development of the hepatitis. Maternal and infant ANA
status should be determined in cases labelled as idiopathic neonatal hepatitis to
exclude undiagnosed maternal SLE as a cause of neonatal cholestasis.

An 8 year old child suffering from asthenia and complete atrioventricular block, 
probably congenital. During the tread-mill test there was a sudden
electrocardiogram change to a ventricular preexcitation pattern. Besides this
rare association, we emphasize the importance of the autonomic balance over the
accessory pathway's electrophysiological properties. The appearance of a latent
accessory pathway might be a substitutive mechanism to counterbalance the serious
impairment of physiologic atrioventricular conduction.

Left ventricular histological examination was performed in a patient with right
ventricular (RV) dysplasia. Although the left ventricle (LV) appeared to have a
normal shape and function, the LV biopsy specimen revealed apparent myocyte
hypertrophy and substantial fibrotic changes without fatty infiltration. It was
not clear whether these considerable histological changes were part of right
ventricular dysplasia or not. The present case indicates that even with normal LV
shape and function in patients with right ventricular dysplasia, histological
examination of LV may provide additional information on its pathogenesis and
prognosis.

A 31-year-old male patient, underwent Mustard operation in childhood for complete
transposition of the great arteries. He required a sequential (DDD-mode)
pacemaker due to a complete symptomatic auriculoventricular block, 25 years after
the operation. Wires were inserted through the left cephalic vein and placed in
the systemic atrium and ventricle, achieving correct sensing and stimulating
thresholds. Atrial rhythm disturbances, specially sinus node dysfunction, are
frequent after Mustard's operation and increase through the years following the
surgical procedure. Atrioventricular conduction disturbances are rare. Treatment 
by endocavitary pacemaker implies a correct knowledge of the special anatomy in
this congenital disease and its surgical correction.

Nocturnal enuresis secondary to heart block: report of cure by cardiac pacemaker 
implantation.

Berul CI(1), Murphy JD.

Author information: 
(1)Division of Cardiology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, PA.

This report describes an unusual case of secondary nocturnal enuresis
presumptively secondary to progressive bradycardia from complete heart block.
Congenital complete heart block occurs in approximately 1 of 22,000 livebirths
and is typically associated with structural congenital heart disease or maternal 
collagen vascular diseases. It can be entirely asymptomatic during infancy and
childhood, depending in part on the escape rate and rhythm and other hemodynamic 
variables. The case described above was not diagnosed until the patient
coincidentally underwent cardiac monitoring. The picture was confusing initially,
as a tricyclic antidepressant medication had been ingested. Heart block is one of
the known cardiovascular effects of tricyclic antidepressant overdose. However,
the conduction disturbance should have resolved as the drug was excreted from the
body. As children with congenital complete heart block get older, the ventricular
escape rate typically decreases. In addition, as activity increases with age,
more demand is placed for cardiac output. The resting end-diastolic volume is
increased to elevate stroke volume in compensation for lower heart rate. As the
escape rate decreases and the metabolic demand increases, patients with
congenital complete heart block then may begin to develop symptoms. Typical
symptoms in children include dizziness, Stokes-Adams syncopal attacks, fatigue,
daytime somnolence, and other somatic complaints. Bedwetting has not been
reported as an initial symptom, but in this case is likely secondary to the
excessive somnolence and difficulty with arousal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Heart block in neonatal lupus erythematosus is typically complete and detected in
utero or in the neonatal period. We describe a child diagnosed with incomplete
heart block at 9 years of age whose mother was diagnosed with Sjögren's syndrome 
and anti-Ro(SSA) 2 years after diagnosis of heart block in her child. This is the
first case of late detection of incomplete heart block in a child felt to be
causally related to the presence of anti-Ro(SSA) in the mother.

Early delivery, immediate ventricular pacing, and inotropic support have failed
to improve the outcome of hydropic fetuses with congenital complete
atrioventricular block. On detection of hydrops, two fetuses were treated with
maternally administered digoxin and furosemide with prompt and sustained
resolution of intrathoracic fluid accumulations. Clearance of serosal fluid
collections may prevent pulmonary hypoplasia and improve cardiac function. Before
proceeding with premature delivery in such patients, a brief trial of
transplacental anti-congestive therapy is indicated.

Complete heart block and seizures in an adult with systemic lupus erythematosus. 
A possible pathophysiologic role for anti-SS-A/Ro and anti-SS-B/La
autoantibodies.

Mevorach D(1), Raz E, Shalev O, Steiner I, Ben-Chetrit E.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: To determine the serum autoantibody profile in an adult patient with
systemic lupus erythematosus manifested by complete heart block (CHB) and
seizures, and to investigate the source of autoantibodies found in the patient's 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
METHODS: The serum and CSF autoantibody profiles were determined by serologic
testing and Western blot studies. An antibody activity index was devised to
determine the source of the autoantibodies found in the CSF.
RESULTS: The patient's serum contained anti-SS-A (52 kd and 60 kd), anti-SS-B,
anti-U1 RNP, and anti-Sm autoantibodies. Studies of her CSF, however, revealed
only anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B autoantibodies, with a high antibody activity index.
CONCLUSION: The finding of anti-SS-A (52 kd and 60 kd) and anti-SS-B
autoantibodies was similar to reported findings in congenital CHB. Intrathecal
synthesis of anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B was the source of autoantibodies found in
the CSF. This patient's symptoms may be pathophysiologically linked to an immune 
reaction between the anti-SS-A and anti-SS-B autoantibodies and neural tissue in 
the brain and heart.

Congenital heart blocks due to immunological causes are rare. A case is reported 
of a fetus with auriculo-ventricular block diagnosed at 22 weeks of amenorrhoea
and intrauterine death at 32 weeks. The authors discussing the case find the most
likely link: an anti-RO (SS-A) and anti-LA (SS-B) immunological block and they
suggest that there are minor localised lesions in the nodal tissue which gives
rise to benign disturbances of cardiac rhythm and they point out ways of
preventing intrauterine auriculo-ventricular block.

Pacemaker implantation in premature infants presents technical problems because
of the relatively larger size of the pulse generator compared with their bodies. 
A new technique with which successful generator implantation was performed in 2
premature infants less than 2,000 g of body weight is described. The generator is
wrapped in a Gore-Tex surgical membrane. A piece of membrane overlying the
electrical contact surface of the generator is removed, and the generator is
fixed to the abdominal wall in the peritoneal cavity. The technique is simple to 
perform and would give relative ease in generator exchange.

Familial congenital sinus rhythm anomalies: clinical and pathological
correlations.

Bharati S(1), Surawicz B, Vidaillet HJ Jr, Lev M.

Author information: 
(1)Congenital Heart and Conduction System Center, Christ Hospital and Medical
Center Oak Lawn, Illinois.

We describe pathological abnormalities in a 72-year-old male member of a family
with a congenital absence of sinus rhythm and a tendency to develop atrial
fibrillation at an early age, and in a 54-year-old female member of a family with
cardiomyopathy and progressive conduction system disease manifested by
first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, left bundle branch block, and atrial
arrhythmias. Both patients died suddenly. The absence of sinus rhythm in case 1
could be explained by marked atrophy, degeneration, and isolation of the
sinoatrial (SA) node. The SA node was also diseased in the member of the other
family with atrial arrhythmias. Additional common features in both cases
included: fatty metamorphosis and degenerative changes of the approaches to the
SA node, the atrial preferential fibers, and the approaches to the AV node, a
small AV node, degenerative changes of the bundle branches, and floppy AV valves.
These findings show that the pathological substrate of familial supraventricular 
arrhythmias consists of a diffuse involvement of the entire conduction system,
bearing resemblance to pathological findings in elderly subjects with acquired
sick sinus syndrome.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B autoantibody responses,
both quantitatively and qualitatively, in relation to the occurrence of
congenital heart block (CHB) and disease activity in a patient with systemic
lupus erythematosus.
METHODS: The patient's course was carefully documented for a period of 80 months.
Specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, a HeLa cell immunoblotting test, and
an RNA precipitation assay were used to determine autoantibody levels and fine
specificities.
RESULTS: Anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibody did not disappear. Levels of
anti-Ro/SS-A appeared to fluctuate more frequently than levels of anti-La/SS-B.
Fluctuations were unrelated to disease activity or immunosuppressive treatment.
There was no characteristic relationship between levels of these antibodies and
the occurrence of CHB.
CONCLUSION: The occurrence of CHB cannot be predicted by frequent measurement of 
anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B levels. The immunoregulatory control of
anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies differs from that of anti-DNA and
anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies.

The pathologic changes in the conduction system beyond the age of ninety.

Bharati S(1), Lev M.

Author information: 
(1)Congenital Heart and Conduction System Center, Heart Institute for Children,
Palos Heights, IL 60463.

The conduction systems of two women who were 92 and 91 years of age,
respectively, were examined by serial section. The first patient had sick sinus
syndrome for more than 20 years, and the second patient had intermittent complete
AV block that alternated with normal sinus rhythm for 12 years before her death. 
Both patients had severe coronary artery disease and had pacemakers and were
doing well. The conduction systems in both revealed fatty metamorphosis in the
approaches to the SA and AV nodes, the SA node, the AV node, and the atria with
fibrotic changes in the ventricular septum, the AV bundle, and the bundle
branches. Patient 1 had normal SA nodal artery and patient 2 had extensive
vascularization of the AV node. As the heart ages, fatty replacement of the atria
affect the SA and AV nodes, and fibrotic changes of the ventricular septum affect
the AV bundle and the bundle branches. Adequate collateral anastomosis to the
conduction system may prevent the development of permanent complete AV block in
the elderly.

Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty is a safe and effective treatment for congenital 
pulmonic valve stenosis. This report describes a child who developed complete
atrioventricular (AV) block following balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. The child 
was treated with a 10-day course of systemic corticosteroids. The heart block
gradually resolved during the first week following the procedure and has not
recurred. Heart block is a known complication of right heart catheterization and 
has been described following balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Systemic
corticosteroids have been used to treat AV block of various etiologies and may
have contributed to the child's recovery in this case.

A 77-year-old woman presented with general weakness, dizziness and slow,
irregular heart beats. An electrophysiologic study revealed a markedly prolonged 
sinus node recovery time of up to 5,900 msec, accompanied with dizziness. A
permanent pacemaker with an AAIR mode was implanted. An abnormal shadow in the
right lower lung field was found on chest x-ray. Selective arteriography revealed
a right internal mammary to right pulmonary artery fistula. No significant
hemodynamic abnormalities were found. This anomaly is extremely rare. Our patient
is the oldest among 20 cases reported in the literature, and is the first one
associated with sick sinus syndrome. Most reported cases have involved surgical
ligation and excision, due to the risk of rupture of the malformation,
endarteritis and congestive heart failure. Our patient refused surgical
intervention and has done well during the past year.

(1)Department of Cardiology, King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, Parel, Bombay,
India.

Congenital complete heart block presenting for the first time in pregnancy is a
therapeutic challenge. Most of the reports are from an era when pacemaker therapy
was in its infancy. Although isolated case reports have appeared, there are no
definite guidelines for the management of such patients. We describe three cases 
of congenital complete heart block presenting in pregnancy. All the patients
delivered normally with temporary pacing support during labor. Two of the three
women remained symptomatic during the postpartum period when they were being
weaned off the pacing support, so they were discharged with permanent pacemaker
implantation. The third woman remained symptom-free during pregnancy, labor, and 
the postpartum period and was discharged without a permanent pacemaker; she is
being followed with routine and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography. We review
the literature in an attempt to formulate a therapeutic policy for such patients.

heart rate was normal after the 5th day of life with a QT-interval of 150 percent
resp. 120 percent after the 15th day. Additionally there were syndactylies of
hands and feet. The infant suddenly died at the age of 5 months. Examination of
the parents revealed a QT-interval of 115 percent as well as synostoses of the
carpus in the father. These microsymptoms are very important for genetic
counseling of the family. There is a recurrence risk of 50 percent for further
children because a dominant trait is to be suggested.

An autopsied case of Takayasu's arteritis associated with complete

formation and diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes into the cardiac conduction
system, particularly the AV node, were similar to those in patients with
connective tissue diseases or congenital complete heart block. The degree of AV
block progressed with aggravation of the disease. These findings suggest that
complete AV block may have been induced by acquired autoimmunity involving the
cardiac conduction system.

This antibody has been associated with congenital complete heart block in
children of mothers with SLE; however, its role in adult high grade AV block is
not clear. We reviewed the 8 published cases of adults with SLE and high grade AV
block. The possible mechanisms that could be implicated in the pathology of high

A 32-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus was found to have a fetus
with heart block and fetal ascites at 23 weeks gestation. Treatment with
high-dose corticosteroids ameliorated the early signs of heart failure, although 
the fetal heart rate gradually fell from 48 beats/min to 42 beats/min by 34
weeks. Sudden deterioration of the fetal state occurred at 35 weeks, and this
only partially responded to digitalisation. Neonatal death occurred on Day 18
from the consequences of severe birth asphyxia. The relationship and pathogenesis
of anti-Ro antibodies, congenital heart block and hydrops fetals are discussed,
together with the in utero management of this condition.

In mothers with anti-Ro-positive antibodies whose previous pregnancies have ended
in deliveries of infants with congenital heart block, prophylactic therapeutic
strategies are used to try to diminish the production and passage into fetal
circulation of autoantibodies. Intravenous gamma globulin was given at 14 and 18 
weeks' gestation and prednisone was given from 14 weeks' gestation to a woman
with Sjögren's syndrome. The pregnancy ended with delivery of an infant without
congenital heart block.

Complete heart block (CHB) in infants and children is usually congenital.
Nonsurgical acquired CHB is rare. Occasionally, transient acquired CHB is seen in
association with viral myocarditis. We describe here an unusual case of transient
CHB in a 12-year-old boy with endomyocardial biopsy-proven myocarditis and

Retrograde (ventriculoatrial) conduction in congenital complete heart block.

Zilo P(1), Gross JN, Andrews CA, Furman S.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New
York 10467.

Retrograde ventriculoatrial (VA) conduction is documented at the time of dual
chamber pacemaker implantation in a 36-year-old patient with congenital complete 
atrioventricular (AV) block. Programmed ventricular stimulation with stimuli of
increasing prematurity demonstrated a lack of decremental conduction via a
unidirectional retrograde pathway. Because retrograde VA conduction has been
associated with pacemaker mediated endless loop tachycardia, the status of
retrograde conduction should be assessed in all patients undergoing dual chamber 
pacemaker implantation, including those with congenital complete AV block who
have previously been considered to have no conductive tissue between atria and
ventricles.

Hill 27599-7570.

Evaluation of fetal bradycardia noted during a routine prenatal visit at 24
weeks' gestation in a mother without symptoms showed an antibody-mediated heart
block with anti-La (SSB) antibody present. The fetus had a pericardial effusion
and ascites. After maternal steroid therapy, the ascites resolved and the
pericardial effusion was substantially diminished. Steroid therapy may be a
helpful adjunct for treatment of a premature infant with hydrops as a result of
antibody-mediated heart block.

Prolonged QT, atrioventricular block, and sudden death in the newborn: an
electrophysiologic evaluation.

Saoudi N(1), Bozio A, Kirkorian G, Atallah G, Normand J, Touboul P.

Author information: 
(1)Hopital Cardiologique, Lyon, France.

An electrophysiologic study was performed in the first month of life in a patient
with the congenital long QT syndrome and spontaneous episodes of 2/1
atrioventricular block. The block could be reproduced by incremental atrial
pacing, and its infrahisian location was associated with a prolongation of the
refractoriness in the ventricular muscle itself. Surprisingly, intravenous
propranolol aggravated this phenomenon by further prolonging the QT interval.
Sudden death occurred shortly thereafter during Holter monitoring and was due to 
a sudden resumption of normal AV conduction after an episode of 2:1 block,
immediately followed by ventricular fibrillation.

Permanent pacing in small children may require placement of an epicardial pacing 
system. This report describes a young child who underwent pacemaker implantation 
with epicardial ventricular lead placement in infancy as an adjunct to
antiarrhythmic therapy for congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia. At 5 years 
of age, a harsh systolic murmur was detected for the first time. Evaluation by
catheterization and transluminal echocardiography showed right ventricular
outflow obstruction (pressure gradient 40 mmHg) secondary to extrinsic
compression by the epicardial lead. Surgical removal of the lead relieved the
obstruction.

Congenital atrioventricular block is a congenital disorder of the cardiac
conducting system. Pacemaker implantation is the treatment of choice for patients
with congenital A-V block if prior medical treatment fails. The criteria for
pacemaker implantation in infants and children are (1) frequent syncope (2) heart
failure (3) ventricular rate below 55 beats/min (4) ventricular arrhythmia (5)
QRS widening in the ECG (6) moderate to severe exercise intolerance. Our
experience with a 15-month-old male child is herein presented. The patient
suffered from frequent attacks of upper respiratory tract infection, bradycardia 
and complete A-V block as found on electrocardiograms. At 15 months old, he was
admitted again due to respiratory tract infection and several attacks of syncope.
Stokes-Adams syndrome was noted several times despite medical treatment.
Following implantation of a VVI mode epicardiac pacemaker, the patient's
condition, including resistance to heart failure and respiration, were improved
dramatically. He was followed up regularly for 4 years, his heart beat remaining 
stable.

Familial IgG subclass imbalance, anti-SS-A antibodies and third-trimester foetal

Nieuwegein, The Netherlands.

Foetal heart block occurred in the second pregnancy of an apparently healthy
23-yr-old woman. Her mother and sister were known for 10 yr with
hypergammaglobulinaemia which was due to a disproportionate polyclonal elevation 
of serum IgG1 and with a high titre of rheumatoid factors. No associated disease 
was obvious. A third-trimester foetal death had occurred with each of these
patients. In the sera of these three women circulating anti-SS-A (Ro) antibodies 
were detected, which are known to be associated with congenital heart block. IgG 
subclass imbalance, consisting of a disproportionate polyclonal elevation of
IgG1, has been recognised as being associated with a characteristic autoantibody 
pattern. Familial occurrence of this syndrome as such has hitherto not been
reported.

It is well documented, that bradycardiac electrical heart activity disturbances
occur very rarely in women of reproductive age. Therapy is in fact redundant in
congenital AV-block. However, acquired AV-block in pregnancy constitutes a risk
for both mother and child. In the following case, we report on an acquired
third-degree AV-block, which worsened during the pregnancy from N.Y.H.A stage I
to stage III, and hence required the implantation of a pacemaker during
pregnancy.

We report on a newborn with fetal acquired heart block (CHB). CHB is a rare,
irreversible defect, commonly occurring in conjunction with myocarditis in the
neonatal lupus syndrome. Development of CHB is strongly associated with maternal 
anti-SS-A(Ro)/SS-B(La) antibodies. Intrauterine therapy of CHB is not possible.
Concomitant myocarditis, however, can be treated effectively with dexamethasone. 
Mothers with an elevated risk of fetal CHB can be identified by their history
(underlying systemic connective tissue disease, previous pregnancies with CHB),
an immunogenetic predisposition (HLA-DR3) and analysis of the SS-A/SS-B antibody 
pattern. In these pregnancies prevention of CHB with plasmapheresis plus
dexamethasone during pregnancy may be possible.

Fetal rhythm disorders are one cause of intrauterine bradycardia. Diagnosis can
be made by fetal echocardiography. Echocardiographic pattern and clinical course 
of the 4 most important fetal bradyarrhythmias are described and compared to the 
corresponding CTG findings. Intermittent sinus bradycardia, atrial extrasystoles 
with 2:1 block and ventricular bigemini have a good prognosis, whereas the
outcome of the fetus with congenital atrioventricular (av)-block is depending
upon degree of bradycardia and association of congenital heart malformation. The 
CTG feature of bigeminal blocked atrial or ventricular extrasystoles is
characterized by rapid change of fetal heart rate between two different frequency
levels. In sinus bradycardia or in congenital av-block no typical CTG pattern is 
evident. Longlasting or repetitive bradycardia should stimulate fetal
echocardiography to detect rhythm disorders in order to better plan the further
course of pregnancy.

Torsade de pointes and syncopal attacks in a 26-year old woman with congenital
complete heart block and prolonged QT interval.

Quek DK(1), Ong SB.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medicine, National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur.

A 26-year old woman with congenital complete heart block and prolonged QT
interval presented for the first time with syncopal attacks associated with
torsade de pointes in adulthood. Cardioversion followed by overdrive pacing was
needed to finally control the unstable rhythm. During episodes of non-capture,
paraoxysms of torsade de pointes leading to ventricular flutter were recorded by 
a 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Beta-blockade and permanent
ventricular pacing finally abolished both the syncopal attacks and the torsade
phenomena. The prognosis of congenital complete heart block associated with QT
prolongation resembles that of the Romano-Ward syndrome. Recognition of this
variant would facilitate earlier treatment of this rare but potentially lethal
disorder.

Atrial arrhythmia is not uncommon in congenital atrial septal defect. Its
incidence increases with age and the hemodynamic compromise of right ventricle.
In the literature, atrial fibrillation is the most common presentation in
middle-aged adults with congenital atrial septal defect, followed by atrial
flutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. However, atrial tachycardia 
with block has rarely been reported. We here report a case of 61-year-old male
with congenital secundum atrial septal defect who presented atrial tachycardia
with block without taking digitalis. Normal sinus rhythm restored after six-day
use of Verapamil and Quinidine.

Center, Madison, WI 53705.

Congenital complete heart block (CCHB) has heterogeneous etiologies. It may occur
as an isolated entity with no associated congenital cardiac malformations and is 
difficult to diagnose even with modern technology. Mesothelioma of the
atrioventricular (AV) node is a benign tumor that causes CCHB. The occurrence of 
this tumor is rare, and a definitive diagnosis of the entity is made only at
autopsy. The conduction disturbance caused by the mesothelioma is potentially
treatable and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CCHB. We
present a case report of a 38-year-old female with CCHB caused by such a tumor.
Clinical diagnosis and treatment of CCHB are reviewed.

The authors present the case of a 27-year old woman with an aneurysm, possibly
originating from an ectopic coronary sprout and communicating with the right
anterior sinus of Valsalva. Secondary syphilitic lesions were observed. By virtue
of its great size and localization, this aneurysm produced obstruction of the
outlet of the right ventricle and dislocation of the left coronary artery. The
authors conclude that this aneurysm was a congenital anomaly because of its great
volume, configuration, the way it opened in the aortic right anterior sinus of
Valsalva, the normal aortic wall and valve, and normal sinuses of Valsalva,
observed at surgery. The follow-up was uneventful.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) is a syndrome characterized by one or all of
the following elements: cutaneous LE lesions, systemic disease, and congenital
heart block. SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La have been implicated in the etiology of NLE, but
because NLE is not uniformly manifested in all offspring of SS-A and SS-B
autoantibody positive mothers, and because of the wide range of clinical
manifestations associated with NLE, other contributing etiologic factors are
being explored. HLA studies have revealed that infants of SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La
positive mothers bearing HLA-A1, B8, DR3, DQ2, and DR52 are at greater risk of
having NLE. Haplotyping in our dizygous twins supports these material HLA
associations.

A 31 year old man presented with intermittent dizziness and electrocardiographic 
evidence of a severe conduction disturbance, with asystolic pauses of up to six
seconds, and was treated by implantation of a permanent pacemaker.
Echocardiography showed an enlarging aneurysm of the right sinus of Valsalva
extending into the interventricular septum. This was confirmed by aortography,
and successful surgical repair was carried out. The characteristic diastolic
expansion of the aneurysm and the demonstration of continuity between the septal 
extension and the related aortic sinus were useful diagnostic features.

A case of congenital atrioventricular block in a newborn whose mother presented
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is reported. Despite intensive care the
child died a few hours after birth. Serial sections of the heart could be
examined. Histology provided information on the appearance and distribution of
the lesions. In particular, the sinus node was small for the child's age, and its
supplying artery was found to have a hyperplastic media with adventitial
sclerosis; the interatrial and interventricular septa showed subendocardial
fibrosis invading the adjacent myocardium. Owing to the scarcity of systematic
histopathological examinations, such lesions have seldom been described. In
addition, a tumour of the atrioventricular node, known as mesothelioma or
hemolymphangioma, was discovered. This case is exceptional in that
histopathological findings similar to those described in SLE, though rarely as
numerous, were associated with a very rare tumour never hitherto described in
such a young patient. The relationship between the two categories of lesions is
discussed.

SS-A antibody has been found to bind to fetal cardiac tissue and is thought to
mediate congenital heart block via transplacental passage. Recent papers have
identified various risk factors thought to define subclasses of SS-A
antibody-positive mothers at greater risk of delivering children with congenital 
heart block. Treatment modalities for antibody-mediated fetal insult are now
expanding and being used clinically. We report a case of a clinically
asymptomatic SS-A antibody-producing mother who gave birth to two SS-A
antibody-positive children with congenital heart block. It is our hope that
ongoing refinement of risk factors and effective therapy will result in
successful in utero palliation of the effects of SS-A antibody.

The sinus disease in children with "healthy hearts" is exceptional, and has never
been documented by tracing of the sinus node. We are reporting two cases of two
children, aged 4 and 14 years. An electrophysiological exploration with
measurement of the direct activity of the sinus node, illustrates in one case the
mechanism of sinus dysfunction. A review from the literature and our cases
specifies some of the characteristics of this disease: 1) there are two forms:
sporadic (case n. 1) 59 published cases, and familial (case n. 2) 28 published
cases in 13 families; 2) the familial forms have a dominant autosomic
transmission with variable penetration; 3) the disease may occur during the first
days of life, suggesting a congenital origin (from the pathology findings, this
disease may be one of the causes of the unexplained sudden death syndrome in
infants; 4) association to atrio-ventricular conduction disorders and atrial and 
ventricular rhythm disorders; 5) frequent indication of stimulators, emphasizing 
the severity of this disease with a more severe course in sporadic forms (7
deaths in 59 cases).

[Difficulties in interpreting the cardiotocogram in atrioventricular arrhythmia

During a routine screening examination of a pregnancy during the 28th gestational
week, a pericardial effusion and ascites were recognized in the fetus. Ultrasound
B- and M-mode evaluation (echocardiography) revealed an atrio-ventricular block
grade III with commencing cardiac insufficiency. Cardiac monitoring (CTG) by
ultrasound (HP 8040A Fetal Monitor) documented primarily the fetal atrial
activity when the logic switch was turned off, but after it was turned on there
was no continuous recording. When fetal heart action was recorded by abdominal
electrocardiogram (AFEKG) the cardiotocography showed simultaneously a
ventricular frequency of 50/min. and a maternal frequency of 70-80/min. This case
confirms that the registration of fetal heart action without real-time imaging is
only of limited value in cases of cardiac-conduction anomalies. It is important
that during ultrasound screening examination, the cardiac heart action is
carefully evaluated.

Congenital complete heart block in an infant with free plasma carnitine
deficiency.

A newborn male presenting with congenital complete heart block was found to have 
low levels of free plasma carnitine. Among the many complications of carnitine
deficiency is a structural disruption of myocardial tissue. A deficiency of
carnitine may be causally related to the presence of cardiac dysrhythmias in this
patient on the basis of mechanical disturbance to the cardiac conducting system.

Anaesthetic management of congenital heart block and persistent ductus arteriosus
in an infant.

Umeh B, Izuora K.

Ketamine hydrochloride, pancuronium bromide and 100% oxygen were used during
general anaesthesia for a left antero-lateral thoracotomy, insertion of a
permanent cardiac pace-maker and ligation of a persistent ductus arteriosus in a 
three-month-old female infant, who was also in congestive cardiac failure. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of successful anaesthetic 
management for insertion of cardiac pace-maker and ligation of persistent ductus 
arteriosus under general anaesthesia in a Nigerian infant. The successful
out-come of our anaesthetic technique encourages us to recommend the procedure
for the anaesthetic management of similar complex cardiac abnormalities.

[Fetal bradycardia caused by arrhythmia. Apropos of a case of blocked staggered
atrial extrasystole].

[Article in French]

Col JY(1).

Author information: 
(1)C.H.G. du Havre.

The author reports a case of fetal bradycardia with a rate of 75 beats per
minute, with atrial extrasystoles and an intermittent auriculo-ventricular
functional block. Cases have rarely been described because the condition is often
not recognized. Bradycardia can be diagnosed as a sign of fetal distress and may 
lead to procedures which are not helpful. Ultrasound has become the mainstay of
diagnosis. The arrhythmia is usually an isolated feature without causing any
trouble, and it usually disappears by itself before or soon after delivery. This 
does not mean that the cause of the arrhythmia should not be sought carefully and
that the fetus should not have careful monitoring during pregnancy and in labour 
(including fetal pH sampling); in general arrangements should be made for a
paediatrician to take over the case after birth. This article reviews the
different types of fetal bradycardia and classifies them into three groups: sinus
bradycardias and sino-auricular dysfunctions auriculo-ventricular blocks which
may or may not be associated with a congenital malformation and often occur if
the mother has a collagen disease with the presence of anti-Ro antibodies, and
paradoxal bradycardias. A system of management of these cases is suggested.

Histopathologic changes in the heart including the conduction system after
catheter ablation.

Bharati S(1), Lev M.

Author information: 
(1)Heart Institute for Children of Christ Hospital and Medical Center, Palos
Heights, Illinois 60463.

The pathology of the heart, including that of the conduction system, after
various catheter techniques used to ablate the various parts of the conduction
system and the myocardium, were examined histologically by serial sections. The
experiments were conducted on canines. The conduction system studies included the
approaches to the AV node, the AV node, the AV bundle and bundle branches, as
well as, the central fibrous body, the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves. The
methods of ablation were DC shock, laser and radio frequency energy. Production
of the complete AV block clinically was associated with fibrosis with or without 
cartilage formation of the approaches to the AV node, the AV node, the bundle and
the beginning of the bundle branches in most cases. On the other hand, creation
of first degree AV block was associated with fibrotic changes in the approaches
to the AV node and the AV node, and second degree block with more changes to the 
AV node. Coronary sinus ablation resulted in necrosis and fibrosis of the
coronary sinus wall with occasional thrombosis of the coronary sinus. The
adjacent atrial and/or the ventricular myocardium also showed fibrosis. Likewise,
ventricular septal ablation was associated with focal areas of fibrosis of the
myocardium. The conduction system was intact in both of the above experiments. In
one human where complete AV block was created to manage intractable atrial
fibrillation, the AV node, the bundle, and the bundle branches were fibrosed. In 
addition, there was a fibrosed atrio-Hisian connection and the patient died
suddenly six weeks after the ablative procedure. The surrounding structures close
to the vicinity of the conduction system, such as the aortic, tricuspid, mitral
valve, the central fibrous body, and the summit ventricular septum are involved
to a varying degree. In summary, (1) Whatever the method of ablation may be, the 
end result was fibrosis with or without cartilage formation of the ablative area.
(2) Congenital anomalies of the conduction system such as an atrio-Hisian
connection may remain elusive for ablative methods, and arrhythmias may persist
and may cause sudden death in some cases.

A case of left ventricular aneurysm of uncertain etiology presenting as

A case of a 59-year-old Asian male with several episodes of syncope and
palpitation is reported. Electrophysiologic study disclosed that sustained
ventricular tachycardia was induced by programmed electrical stimulation at the
right ventricular apex. The electrogram in the left ventricular aneurysm showed
delayed activities and the fastest depolarization. Entrainment was observed by
faster pacing. Left ventriculography showed a large aneurysm and normal coronary 
arteries. Congenital left ventricular aneurysm is the most likely clinical
diagnosis given the lack of past history of chest pain, myocarditis,
cardiomyopathy, etc. Congenital aneurysm which presents as ventricular
tachycardia is very rare, and has never been reported in an Asian. Medical
management has thus far been successful.

A retrospective literature review revealed that in 41% of cases of complete
congenital heart block (CCHB) there was at least one other affected sibling,
emphasizing the considerable risk of carrying a second affected fetus with CCHB. 
Therefore an aggressive approach was taken to prevent CCHB in a fetus with a high
risk for the condition as defined by (1) presence of DR3 and high titers of
antibodies to SSA(Ro) and SSB(La) in the mother (2) previous history of CCHB in a
sibling. In a feasibility study, thrice weekly plasmapheresis was initiated in
the 19th week of gestation to remove antibodies from the maternal circulation in 
advance of major placental transport to the developing fetus. Prednisone was also
administered to decrease antibody synthesis. The concentration of total maternal 
IgG and antibodies to SSA(Ro) and SSB(La) were decreased by greater than 60%
during the course of therapy. Planned delivery of a healthy baby was done at 36
weeks.

Precise preoperative diagnostic clarification was accomplished in an infant with

veins in relation to the posterior wall of the common atrium necessitated a
specific baffle in order to prevent pulmonary or systemic venous obstruction. The
development of a sick sinus syndrome six months after surgery is in keeping with 
the natural history of the disease.

Thrombocytopenia in the neonatal lupus syndrome.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Dermatology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore.

Thrombocytopenia has been documented infrequently in association with congenital 
heart block or lupus dermatitis in the neonatal lupus erythematosus syndrome. We 
report the cases of two infants with transient neonatal thrombocytopenia born to 
mothers with connective-tissue disease. Both mother/infant pairs were Ro(SS-A)
antibody positive. Although the finding of neonatal thrombocytopenia in the
presence of maternal connective-tissue disease suggests an autoimmune
thrombocytopenia, platelet antibody studies were negative in both mother/infant
pairs. We have found the Ro (SS-A) antibody with increased frequency in
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenia associated with
Sjögren's syndrome, but the nature of the association is unknown. We suggest that
thrombocytopenia in our patients is a manifestation of the neonatal lupus
erythematosus syndrome. This syndrome should be included in the differential
diagnosis of neonatal thrombocytopenia.

Pathology of primary congenital complete heart block.

Hackel DB(1).

Author information:

Carolina.

Studies were done on the hearts of 4 infants and 2 adults with the clinical
diagnosis of congenital complete heart block (CCHB) and on the hearts of 6
control patients of similar age groups but without any significant arrhythmia.
All 6 patients with CCHB had absence of the fibers [approaches to
atrioventricular node (AVN)] connecting the atrium and the AVN and common bundle 
(CB), as well as having partial or complete absence of the AVN. The mothers of 2 
of the 4 infants with CCHB had antibodies to Ro antigen, and one mother (with Ro 
antibody) had evidence of having had active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
One infant developed SLE before the age of 1 yr. In one of the 2 adult cases with
CCHB, the patient had evidence of having developed his CHB after birth, and the
other adult patient probably had his CCHB since birth. It was suggested that
these findings--and others in the literature--could be explained by there being
two factors that lead to the occurrence of idiopathic heart block, whether it be 
truly congenital or acquired later in life: (a) a genetic predisposition to the
condition together with (b) a precipitating injury. Thus, a patient with a
genetic predisposition to insults to his conducting fibers might develop CCHB in 
utero due to some insult (e.g., due to damage by circulating anti-DNA antibodies 
in patients with SLE or by other unknown insults); or the "weak" fibers could be 
affected later in life by many different injuries--whether viral,
hypersensitivity, anoxic, or due to aging.

Conduction system in a trained jogger with sudden death.

Bharati S(1), Dreifus LS, Chopskie E, Lev M.

08015-1799.

A 47-year-old extremely active, entirely asymptomatic trained jogger was found
dead in bed. He was known to have had sinus bradycardia with first-degree
atrioventricular block for eight years and a type 1 second-degree block five
years prior to death. A permanent pacemaker had been inserted, and apparently the
patient was then in good health and maintained his jogging program until he died 
suddenly. The conduction system revealed an atrioventricular node situated more
to the left of the atrial septum than usual, which made tenuous connection with
the surrounding atria due to marked fatty infiltration. The atrioventricular node
as it joined the left-sided His bundle revealed fatty metamorphosis, fibrosis,
disarray of myocardial fibers, and mononuclear cell infiltration. The right
bundle branch was intramyocardial and fibrosed throughout. Increased aging
changes of the left side of the septum with arteriolosclerosis and patchy
fibrosis were present. This is the first case in which the atrioventricular node 
was more to the left side of the atrial septum with fatty separation of the node 
from the surrounding atrial musculature, with myocardial disarray of the
nodal-His bundle junction. Although congenital abnormality of the conduction
system may remain silent without symptoms for a long time, it should be kept in
mind that sudden death may occur sooner or later in some susceptible individuals.

A family is described in which an asymptomatic woman gave birth to a male child
with complete congenital heart block. Precipitating antibodies to the Ro/SSA
antigen have developed in this child, now aged 33, who is clinically well. In the
mother, features of both systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome
developed 26 years after the birth of her son. Her serum currently has
precipitating antibodies to both the Ro/SSA and La/SSB antigens. The presence of 
anti-Ro/SSA in the child with complete congenital heart block and the extremely
long delay of 26 years between the delivery of the child and the development of
clinical disease in the mother are discussed in light of investigators'
developing knowledge of both neonatal and adult systemic lupus erythematosus.

Stokes-Adams attacks are a well-known complication of congenital complete heart
block. Although they are generally felt to be precipitated by either bradycardia 
or tachycardia, this is poorly documented. A case is presented in which a 23
month old with congenital complete heart block and an intermittently prolonged QT
interval had a Stokes-Adams attack during a spontaneous episode of ventricular
tachycardia. The combination of congenital complete heart block and a prolonged
QT interval carries a significant risk of ventricular tachycardia.

An autopsy case of congenital atrioventricular (AV) heart block is described. A

birth. Autopsy revealed hematoxylin bodies in the AV node, central fibrous body, 
and fibrous annulus of the heart. Also, immunoglobulin G (IgG) localization in
the hematoxylin bodies was demonstrated by an immunoperoxidase technique. It is
suggested that IgG or immune complexes crossed the placenta and that the immune
deposition directly injured the cardiac conduction system, causing AV block.

Fetal heart rate monitoring was combined with fetal echocardiography for
examination of atrial reactivity during labour in five fetuses with second or
third degree heart block. Alterations in vagal tone accompanying uterine
contraction influence atrial rate, even when the ventricle is not under atrial
'control'. Fetal echocardiography enabled diagnosis of the underlying basis of
the arrhythmia and located the optimal position for recording atrial activity
with an external heart rate monitor. External and internal monitoring of atrial
activity demonstrated reactivity during labour. Two patients were delivered
vaginally after monitoring throughout labour. One mother preferred elective
caesarean delivery. Caesarean section was required in another for cephalopelvic
disproportion and in the remaining woman for late decelerations. These monitoring
techniques provide an assessment of fetal well-being in the presence of fetal
bradycardia due to variable degrees of heart block.

This is a case of a child with neonatal lupus and congenital atrioventricular
(AV) block, born to a mother with asymptomatic, systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE). The child, despite pacemaker insertion, died of septicemia and myocarditis
at the age of three months. Although the association of neonatal lupus with
congenital AV block is well-recognized, there are only few pathologic studies of 
the conduction system reported in the literature. This is such a study in which
we emphasize that, due to an altered immune system in the child, septicemia may
be the cause of death in some cases.

Congenital heart block and cardiac anomalies in the absence of maternal
connective tissue disease.

Shenker L, Reed KL, Anderson CF, Marx GR, Sobonya RE, Graham AR.

The association of congenital heart block with maternal connective tissue disease
and autoimmunity has been recently reported. Two cases of heart block were
diagnosed in utero at 23 and 24 weeks' gestation. Both mothers had extensive
workups for connective tissue disease that were negative. Two-dimensional and
Doppler echocardiography were performed in utero and both infants had left atrial
isomerism, atrioventricular canal defects, and severe hydrops in addition to
heart block. Review of the recent literature identifies a subset of congenital
heart block in which the mothers have no evidence for connective tissue disease, 
and the fetus or neonate has complex cardiac malformations and hydrops. The
common features in these babies are atrioventricular canal defects and isomerism.
No reports of congenital heart disease among the children of mothers with
connective tissue disease fit this description. Our recent experience and
literature review emphasize the previously known association between congenital
heart block and congenital heart disease. This association is especially
important in light of the poor prognosis for this group of fetuses and neonates.

reported in 1914 by Nanta and today some 100 cases are documented. Heart block
may be congenital or acquired secondary to cardiac surgery, rheumatic heart
disease, or infective disorders. Heart block, whether congenital or acquired,
rarely creates any special obstetric problems. Today there is an increasing use
of cardiac pacemakers in younger people and the first reported obstetric
experience with a cardiac pacemaker implanted before pregnancy was by Shouse and 
Acker. This review will document the course and outcome of all reported
pregnancies in women conceiving with an artificial pacemaker, and discuss
complications and principles of management. We will also report our experience
with a woman suffering from a complete heart block in whom an internal cardiac
pacemaker was inserted before pregnancy.

Fetal viral myocarditis and congenital complete heart block in a pregnancy
complicated by systemic lupus erythematosus. A case report.

Repke JT, Kuhajda F, Hochberg MC, Johnson TR, Winn K, Provost T.

Congenital complete heart block has been associated with collagen vascular
disorders. Many etiologies have been proposed for the myocarditis that develops
and results in the complete heart block. Transplacental antibody
transfer--specifically, antibodies to tissue-soluble ribonuclear protein
antigen-A--has been implicated as the etiology of the myocarditis. This case
supports the association of this antibody while suggesting that viral infection
may serve as an initiator of the autoimmune destruction. Also, fetal viral
infection alone must be considered a possible cause of congenital complete heart 
block.

DDD pacing: clinical considerations.

Vatterott PJ, Vlietstra RE, Hayes DL.

DDD pacemakers offer a physiologic form of pacing for selected patients by
incorporating atrioventricular synchrony over a wide range of atrial rates.
Selection of a patient for DDD pacing necessitates a thorough knowledge of the
individual functions of the DDD pacemaker, the limitations of DDD pacing, and the
patient's own electrical and physiologic needs. Continuing developments in
cardiac pacing include further reduction of the possibility of pacemaker-mediated
tachycardia, increased matching to metabolic needs, and advancement of telemetric
technology and electrophysiologic testing.

Grigg LE, Downey W, Tatoulis J, Hunt D.

A patient with a rare intracardiac tumor arising from the right side of the
interventricular septum who developed conduction disturbances and symptoms of
right ventricular outflow tract obstruction is reported. The patient was
successfully treated with insertion of a permanent pacemaker and surgical removal
of the tumor after two-dimensional echocardiography diagnosed the intracardiac
mass. Pathologic examination confirmed the benign nature of the tumor and showed 
the unusual features of both ectopic thyroid and benign congenital polycystic
tumor.

Intrauterine therapy for presumptive fetal myocarditis with acquired heart block 
due to systemic lupus erythematosus. Experience in a mother with a predominance
of SS-B (La) antibodies.

Buyon JP, Swersky SH, Fox HE, Bierman FZ, Winchester RJ.

An experimental therapeutic regimen for congenital lupus erythematosus, which
consists of treating the mother with high doses of dexamethasone and performing
plasmapheresis (3 times per week), was developed. This regimen was administered
to a woman whose pregnancy was complicated by the abrupt onset of fetal
pericarditis, myocarditis, and complete heart block in the twenty-fourth week of 
gestation. The effectiveness of plasmapheresis was evidenced by a decrease in the
very high titer of SS-B (La) antibodies in the mother. After 5 weeks of therapy, 
the cardiac disease was ameliorated. The infant tolerated delivery at week 31,
and the heart block has persisted. The rationale for this therapy for fetal
disease is discussed, with emphasis on 2 goals: to diminish the quantity of
maternal antibody that is transmitted to the fetus, and to suppress the
manifestations of fetal carditis with the use of glucocorticoids that are not
inactivated by the placenta. Tentative recommendations for more intensive
prenatal monitoring of maternal and fetal status for those at risk are outlined.

Netherlands.

The case is described of a boy with some right ventricular dysplasia and episodes
of ventricular tachycardia of left bundle branch block pattern who had symptoms
from the age of 1 month. Angiography and cardiac biopsy demonstrated major
involvement of the left ventricular myocardium. A sister of the patient presented
at the age of 2 months with predominantly left ventricular cardiomyopathy;
clinical signs and angiography suggested the presence of right ventricular
dysplasia as well. She died suddenly at the age of 9 years. Her brother, now aged
14 years, is being treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. The hypothesis of this
cardiomyopathy being a variant of "arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia
syndrome" is discussed.

Pathogenesis of heart block in a fatal case of dermatomyositis.

Approximately 70% of patients with dermatomyositis have evidence of cardiac
damage; in one third of cases this affects principally or solely the conduction
tissue. In infants similar histological lesions have been associated with a
maternal autoantibody, anti-Ro, that crosses the placenta and produces congenital
heart block. Anti-Ro antibody was detected in a fatal case of dermatomyositis
with lesions of the conduction system.

Congenital swallowing-induced symptomatic heart block: a case report of a
probably hereditary disorder.

Golf S, Forfang K.

A 15-year-old girl had had syncope induced by swallowing since infancy. An ECG
recorded during food intake revealed SA block with very slow junctional and
ventricular escape rhythms. No symptoms or signs of other cardiac disorders or
gastrointestinal diseases were present. Activation of a strong vagal reflex, able
to inhibit impulse formation and propagation in an otherwise normal heart, is the
most likely explanation of the disorder in this patient. Furthermore, ECGs of her
close relatives which were recorded during food intake as compared with the
findings in a reference group (n = 20), indicated that a genetic factor could be 
involved.

Prenatal diagnosis and outcome of congenital complete heart block: the role of

Author information: 
(1)Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit.

Between January 1, 1980, and March 1, 1986, congenital complete heart block
(CCHB) was diagnosed in 11 fetuses utilizing 2-dimensional and M-mode fetal
echocardiography. Four of the eleven cases (36.4%) had otherwise structurally
normal hearts; 3 survived the perinatal and neonatal period and 1 patient died at
22 days of age. All mothers in this group had systemic lupus erythematosus. Seven
of the eleven fetuses (63.6%) presented with CCHB and associated cardiac
malformations. All patients in this group died either in utero or shortly after
birth. The discovery of CCHB with associated structural malformations of the
heart carries an ominous prognosis for fetal and neonatal survival. The diagnosis
of CCHB without associated cardiac malformations carries a more favorable
outlook. Accurate prenatal diagnosis of CCHB and underlying cardiac status
facilitates parental counseling and patient management planning.

Anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies and congenital complete heart block.

McNeil P, Edmonds J.

Maternal anti-Ro (SS-A) antibodies have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
congenital complete heart block. When congenital complete heart block occurs,
SS-A antibodies are almost always present in maternal and fetal serum, although
not all infants of SS-A antibody positive mothers are affected. We describe a
situation in which antibodies to SS-A were present in high titre in both maternal
and fetal serum, although there was no evidence of heart block in the infant.
This is the first report of a normal infant in whom maternally derived SS-A
antibodies have been documented in high titre.

Ro (SS-A) antibody and antigen in a patient with congenital complete heart block.

Harley JB, Kaine JL, Fox OF, Reichlin M, Gruber B.

Congenital complete heart block is closely associated with the presence of
anti-Ro (SS-A) autoantibodies. Quantitative solid-phase assays for Ro (SS-A)
autoantigen and autoantibody have established the presence of Ro (SS-A) in
cardiac tissues and have been used to evaluate an informative pedigree. The
propositus we describe here had complete congenital heart block and showed
anti-Ro (SS-A) binding of 13-fold less than his normal HLA-identical twin sister.
Both had identical titers of antinuclear antibody. These data support the
hypothesis that anti-Ro (SS-A) may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of
congenital complete heart block.

Possible mechanisms of the arrhythmias in the long QT syndrome.

Coumel P, Leclercq JF, Lucet V.

Torsades de pointes (TP) are observed in the setting of four different clinical
syndromes. Two are easily recognized by prolongation of the QT interval: acquired
and congenital long QT syndromes (LQTS). Two have no patent long QT, but they do 
have many characteristics in common with the LQTS: catecholamine-dependent
ventricular tachycardias, and short-coupled TP. The mechanism of TP is
undetermined. Re-entry phenomena as well as early after depolarizations,
occurring in a single or several arrhythmogenic areas may equally explain the
curious pattern and behaviour of TP, and the lack of an experimental model makes 
difficult the progress of our knowledge. A fundamental myocardial disorder might 
be common to the different clinical syndromes. The existence of a substrate for
the arrhythmia was reflected in one of our patients by the large discrepancy
between the endocardial and epicardial refractory period duration. A common
substrate, with different inputs and outputs, would explain consistently (a) why 
the autonomic nervous system is always involved in triggering TP, but in variable
and even opposite ways according to the syndrome in cause, and (b) why the TP
response to drugs is also variable and often paradoxical.

Guarnerio M, Disertori M, Vergara G, Furlanello F.

Here we report on the case of a patient with idiopathic complete AV block and
ventricular ectopic beats in basal state. The patient had been asymptomatic until
the age of 50 and then suddenly began to suffer from relapsing episodes of
syncope, related to "Torsade de Pointe" and Ventricular Fibrillation
(hypokalaemia was present at the same time). We deal with the prognostic
significance of ventricular ectopic beats and we make the hypothesis that
hyperkinetic ventricular arrhythmias play a role in the origin of the symptoms of
patients with congenital or idiopathic complete AV block. Finally, we discuss the
limits of the therapeutic effectiveness of permanent pacing in these cases.

[Fetal death caused by myocarditis and isolated congenital auriculoventricular
block].

[Article in French]

Herreman G, Ferme I, Morel S, Batisse J, Vuon NP, Meyer O.

A 26-year old woman gave birth, at term, to a child with isolated complete heart 
block. A second pregnancy was interrupted by foetal death. Among other
immunological abnormalities, this young woman had an antibody resembling the
anti-SS-B antibody. At pathological examination the foetus' heart was found to be
free of malformation but presented with subacute myocarditis associated with
microcalcifications of the conductive tissue. Such findings suggest that an
incipient myocarditis may either result in foetal death or lead to fibrosis of
conduction pathways with isolated complete heart block.

Congenital complete heart block and SSA antibodies: obstetric implications.

Singsen BH, Akhter JE, Weinstein MM, Sharp GC.

Mothers with known or occult rheumatic disorders may be delivered of infants with
congenital complete heart block. The more frequent use of ultrasonography during 
pregnancy now allows early detection of heart block in utero. The transplacental 
passage of SSA or SSB antibodies, of the IgG class, may mediate or be associated 
with immune damage to the fetal cardiac conduction system, as reported in our two
patients. Maternal and/or newborn screening for SSA and SSB antibodies in
selected patients permits an early presumptive diagnosis and will assist
perinatal planning, particularly for immediate newborn cardiac pacemaker
implantation. Early serologic detection of such antibodies may also assist family
counseling of mothers at risk and should promote investigation of techniques to
modify the immune status of these mothers. SSA- or SSB-positive maternal/fetal
pairs should be prospectively managed by the obstetrician, neonatologist, and
rheumatologist.

Infantile complete heart block associated with maternal Ro(SS-A)
ribonucleoprotein autoantibodies: report of two cases.

Epstein RJ, Gatenby PA, Whittingham SF, McNeilage LJ, Henderson-Smart DJ, Basten 
A.

Two cases of congenital complete heart block arising during pregnancy were
observed in association with a circulating maternal autoantibody to the soluble
ribonucleoprotein Ro(SS-A). Neither mother had clinical evidence of Sjögren's
syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus usually associated with anti-Ro.
However, both had a previous history of first-trimester abortion and laboratory
evidence of autoimmunity, and one gave a history of sialadenitis. Maternal
anti-Ro antibodies may be predictive of infantile heart block when present in
pregnant women with overt or suspected multisystem autoimmune disease.

[Problem of fetal arrhythmias--a case report].

[Article in German]

Voigt HJ, Singer H.

A fetal congenital complete AV-block was detected in the 30th week of gestation. 
After close sonographic and cardiotocographic follow-up examinations premature
labor occurred in the 37th week of gestation. The interpretation of the fetal
heart rate pattern was difficult. The bradycardia was accompanied by late
decelerations (dip II), only different from familiar hypoxia-patterns by the
bradycardia. Caesarean section therefore was immediately done. A partial abruptio
placentae was found as causing hypoxia. The child developed well after insertion 
of a temporary transvenous pacemaker. The AV-block is still persisting. At the
age of three months the child fell ill of an acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
The symptoms disappeared after unspecific treatment. Antinuclear antibodies
pathognomonic for lupus erythematosus were traceable in the symptomless mother.
There are other observations of motherly autoantibodies passing the placental
barrier impairing the fetal heart conduction.

Peri-operative management and administration of anaesthesia in children with

Linton DM, Human DG.

The clinical presentation and natural history of congenital complete heart block 
(CHB) differ from those of acquired third-degree heart block. Although
perioperative prophylactic cardiac pacing is considered mandatory in patients
with acquired CHB, it is not usually necessary in children with asymptomatic
congenital heart block. The anaesthetist should be able to identify which
patients require temporary perioperative pacing, and should modify his
anaesthetic technique appropriately for patients who do not. An 8-year-old
patient with congenital CHB who required emergency surgery for acute appendicitis
is presented and the anaesthetic management, including the indications for
pacing, is discussed.

Pseudocoarctation of the aortic arch in a patient with Turner's syndrome.

Klein LW, Levin JL, Weintraub WS, Agarwal JB, Helfant RH.

Pseudocoarctation of the aortic arch is a rare congenital anomaly which resembles
true coarctation by the presence of a narrowing in the descending thoracic aorta 
immediately distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. However, it is
differentiated from that entity by the absence of a significant hemodynamic
obstruction and by the presence of aneurysmal dilatation proximal and distal to
the area of narrowing. As a result, the commonly observed clinical findings of
coarctation such as a prominent collateral circulation and decreased blood
pressure in the lower extremities are not observed. "Kinking" or "buckling" are
common adjectives used to describe the roentgenographic appearance of the aortic 
arch in this condition. The association of various congenital cardiac
abnormalities with pseudocoarctation has been reported, and are similar to those 
commonly seen with true coarctation. We now present the first reported case of
pseudocoarctation associated with a probable bicuspid aortic valve in a patient
with Turner's syndrome.

Congenital atrioventricular block in right atrial isomerism (asplenia). A case
due to atrionodal discontinuity.

Rossi L, Montella S, Frescura C, Thiene G.

The association of complex congenital heart disease with asplenia syndrome and
congenital AV block is described in a newborn. Cardiovascular lesions were right 
atrial isomerism, d-loop, discordant ventriculoarterial connection, pulmonary
stenosis, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, absent right pulmonary
artery, and bilateral superior vena cava. The ECG recording disclosed complete AV
block with narrow QRS (suprahisian block). The histology of the conduction system
revealed two AV nodes, one anterior and one posterior, none of which connected
with the atrial myocardium; only the posterior node was continuous with a
penetrating and bifurcating bundle. The histologic findings were consistent with 
the suprahisian AV block due to lack of connection between the atria and the
regular posterior AV specialized junction.

Maternal permanent bradycardia: pregnancy and delivery.

Abramovici H, Faktor JH, Gonen Y, Brandes JM, Amikam S.

Presented are six women with permanent bradycardia without myocardial
involvement. Four women were asymptomatic, and two had repeated Adams-Stokes
attacks and required the use of permanent pacemakers. All six women had 18
pregnancies with 15 deliveries of normal infants. During pregnancy and delivery
all patients remained asymptomatic (functional capacity 1). The various
cardiologic and obstetric aspects of these patients are discussed, and it is
concluded that pregnancy and delivery in women with permanent bradycardia is
possible, and their outcome is no different from that of normal, healthy women.
However, cases with associated myocardial disease carry an increased risk and
should therefore be carefully monitored during pregnancy and delivery.

A complete fetal heart block was diagnosed in 29 weeks gestation by means of

effect of atrial and ventricular movements. Because of increasing fetal ascites
and edema, Digoxin treatment is given from 31 weeks gestation until birth. 30
hours postnatal the child develops congestive heart failure which disappeared
completely after pacemaker treatment. We stress the importance of early diagnosis
with possibility of prenatal treatment and optimal planning of delivery in

Atrioventricular block in situs ambiguus and left isomerism (polysplenia
syndrome).

Roguin N, Pelled B, Freundlich E, Yahalom M, Riss E.

Three patients are described who had situs ambiguus and left isomerism
(polysplenia syndrome) and advanced atrioventricular block. One presented with a 
complex bradyarrhythmia with Wenckebach block. The other two had congenital
atrioventricular block with a narrow QRS at a ventricular rate of 80 per minute, 
an atrial rate of 150' per minute, and both had a P wave axis directed superiorly
and to the right in one, and superiorly to the left in the other. This ECG
pattern was not observed in more than 400 adult patients with complete A-V block 
treated in our service. It is our opinion that in infants and children with heart
disease the presence of complete A-V block with narrow QRS and an unusual P waves
axis directed superiorly is strongly suggestive of left isomerism. The incidence 
rate of complete A-V block in left isomerism is nearly twenty percent of the
cases described.

[Torsades de pointes initiated by slow ventricular stimulation].

[Article in French]

Fontaine G, Frank R, Lascault G, Tonet JL, Fillette F, Grosgogeat Y.

The authors report a case of isolated and probably congenital complete heart
block with spontaneous torsades de pointes preceded by an increase in the QT
interval. During positioning of a temporary pacing catheter mechanically induced 
extrasystoles were observed, which seem to favor ventricular extrasystoles and
unsustained runs of torsades de pointes. When the basal rhythm showed no
extrasystoles, electrical stimulation delivered late in diastole captured the
ventricle normally and was then followed in reproducible fashion by episodes of
torsades de pointes or minor equivalents. The mechanism of this phenomenon is
thought to be related to a concealed phase 4 intramyocardial block. It may have
important practical consequences in paced patients predisposed to torsades de
pointes. If the pacemaker is programmed at too slow a rate, with stimulation
falling late in diastole, torsades de pointes could occur, some attacks of which 
are known to degenerate to true ventricular fibrillation.

[Congenital heart block in a newborn infant born to a mother with lupus
erythematosus].

[Article in Spanish]

Jiménez R, Figueras J, Botet F, Cruz M.

We report a case of a newborn with a congenital heart-block. Clinical picture
began with bradycardia and heart failure from birth. The mother had a systemic
lupus erythematosus in remission during pregnancy suffering a reactivation after 
delivery. This report deals about the greater incidence of congenital heart-block
in the lupus-mother's newborns and we expose some etiopathogenic hypothesis. Also
we point-out the easy clinical and electrocardiographic diagnosis that shows a
third degree heart-block with atrioventricular dissociation and atrial frequency 
two or three times greater than ventricular. It's established the differential
diagnosis among neonatal bradycardias and congenital heart-blocks. The treatment 
with isoproterenol was ineffective. A pacemaker was need.

[His-bundle electrographic localization of a complete intra-His AV block in a
patient with congenital corrected transposition of the great vessels].

[Article in German]

Sheikhzadeh A, Ghabussi P, Pourkalbassi H, von Kurnatowski HA.

Patients with corrected congenital transposition of the large arteries (CCT)
often develop atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances, which may lead to
syncope or sudden death. This report is concerned with our findings in a
24-year-old man with a CCT accompanied by a small ventricular septal defect and a
complete AV block. While published case reports of electrophysiologically
investigated third-degree AV blocks show conduction disturbances proximal to the 
bundle of His, we found the block to be localized in the intra-His region, which 
makes the case a rarity.

Management of fetal complete atrioventricular block.

Yamada M, Sakakibara S, Utsu M, Chiba Y.

Congenital atrioventricular block was diagnosed with B-mode and M-mode
ultrasonography at the 30th week of gestation in a bradycardic fetus. Major
anomalies were excluded and prenatal fetal well-being was monitored with daily
B-mode and maternal perception of fetal movement to detect circulatory
derangement at an early stage. Because of the sudden onset of circulatory
failure, emergency Caesarean section was performed to save the otherwise normal
fetus. Two days later, the infant developed ventricular fibrillation, for which
surgical intervention was indicated. Pacemaking was effective in reestablishing
the neonatal circulation.

Delayed maternal lupus after delivery of offspring with congenital heart block.

Kasinath BS, Katz AI.

An association between maternal connective tissue disease, especially lupus, and 
congenital complete heart block in the offspring has been recently recognized. In
general, maternal lupus is clinically or serologically manifest by the time the
infant with heart block is born, although in some cases the appearance of
maternal disease may be delayed for some time. Systemic lupus erythematosus
occurred in the mother of three children with congenital heart block 16 years
after delivery of her first affected child. To our knowledge this represents the 
longest latency period for the appearance of maternal disease on record.

Anatomic substrate for congenital atrioventricular block in middle-aged adults.

Bharati S, Rosen KM, Strasberg B, Rigby E, Lev M.

Congenital atrioventricular block is usually a benign disorder not necessitating 
pacing. In some patients slowing of rate and/or mortality have been noted with
aging. However an anatomic substrate has not been established for the progressive
slowing of the escape rate. In this study we report an anatomic substrate in two 
such patients who were dying in congestive heart failure, ages 49 and 42,
respectively. Multiple pre-mortem ECG's in both cases revealed wide QRS escape
rhythms, and escape rates of approximately 35 and 28 beats/minute, respectively. 
Conduction system examination by serial section in both cases revealed lack of
connection between the atrial septum with the peripheral conduction system with
total replacement by fat of the AV nodal approaches and AV node, and advanced
sclerosis of the summit of the ventricular septum which was more marked on the
right side. In addition, the His bundle showed marked septation in case one and
fragmentation in case two. Sclerosis of the summit of the ventricular septum
involved the branching bundle and the bundle branches in both cases. In
conclusion, both patients had the characteristic lesions of congenital
atrioventricular block, namely replacement of the AV node and AV nodal approaches
by fat, with lack of connection to the peripheral conduction system, and one also
had a fragmented His bundle. In addition premature aging of the summit of the
ventricular septum may have reflected the long-standing hemodynamic stresses of
chronic bradycardia. This in turn resulted in trifascicular involvement of the
conduction system leading to a shifting of the escape rhythm distally eventuating
in a slower idioventricular escape rhythm.

A second zone of compensation during atrial premature stimulation: evidence for
decremental conduction in the sinoatrial junction.

Tzivoni D, Jordan J, Mandel WJ, Barrett PA, Fink B, Yamaguchi I.

125 consecutive patients with premature atrial stimulation were studied. Three
demonstrated sinus node return cycles that were fully compensatory following
premature atrial stimuli delivered early in diastole. This second zone of
compensation was unaccompanied by significant alterations in the post-return
cycle lengths or in P-wave morphology of the return cycle. To account for the
occurrence of a complete compensatory pause following very early premature atrial
depolarizations, we consider the possibility that retrograde conduction of the
early atrial premature depolarization (APD) in the sinoatrial junction was
delayed for a sufficient length of time to allow the sinus node to depolarize
spontaneously on schedule. Collision between the APD and sinus beat would then
occur despite the marked prematurity of the APD. Thus, the early APD had
encountered the relative refractory period of the sinoatrial junction, suggesting
that decremental conduction takes place within the sinoatrial region in man.
These findings imply that there is the potential for reentry in the region of the
human sinoatrial junction.

Long-term endocardial atrial pacing in children with postoperative
bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome and limited ventricular access.

McGoon MD, Maloney JD, McGoon DC, Danielson GK.

Permanent pacing in children, including those with postoperative
bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome has been compromised by the availability of
pulse generators, electrode leads and implantation techniques designed for the
adult patient. Recent technologic improvements and simplified implantation
techniques have reduced many of these barriers and have made endocardial as well 
as epicardial ventricular pacing more feasible. However, in some children,
ventricular pacing may be impeded by anatomic abnormalities due to congenital
anomalies or prior cardiac operations. In these instances, endocardial atrial
pacing may provide an alternative therapeutic approach in selected patients. This
report describes the use of endocardial atrial demand pacing in four children
with postoperatively bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome and restricted ventricular 
access. This approach controls symptomatic bradycardia, helps prevent and convert
paroxysmal intraatrial tachycardia and overcomes the problems of limited
ventricular access.

[Intra-uterine detection of atrio-ventricular block in two children whose mother

[Article in French]

Herreman G, Betous F, Batisse P, Bessis R, Lesavre P, Ferme I.

A woman with isolated juvenile Sjögren's syndrome gave birth, at 3 years'
interval, to two children with complete atrio-ventricular heart block (AVB). This
is the first published case of AVB in children of mothers with Sjögren's syndrome
without any clinical and laboratory evidence of connective tissue disease,
notably lupus. Ultrasonography showed that the AVB was acquired in utero and
occurred during the 23rd week of gestation. In both children the AVB was
isolated, without any symptom of congenital malformation of the heart; there were
no abnormalities of conduction in the mother. Early corticosteroid treatment of
the mother's disease had no beneficial effect on AVB in the foetuses. Attempts to
reproduce the condition experimentally met with failure.

[Deep hypothermia for the correction of a congenital cardiac defect complete with
atrioventricular block].

[Article in Italian]

Lazzari A, De Tommasi SM, Vanini V, Valsecchi O, Brevi M, Colombi C, Carminati M.

The techniques of deep hypothermia for correction of congenital cardiac defects
are well known in many cardiac centers and many cases can be treated even if
there are pre-existing rhythm troubles. Our patient had the following diagnosis: 
left atrial isomerism, dextrocardia; left sided azygos continuation of inferior
vena cava; left and right superior venae cavae, hepatic veins, pulmonary veins,
all draining into a common atrium; d-loop with normally related ventricles;
ventriculo-arterial concordance, small VSD. In addition complete a-v block was
present. The patient, 40 days old and 3.4 kg., in heart failure, was paced with a
temporary transvenous catheter at 130/min and, afterwards, catheterized. Surgery 
was undertaken three days post-catheterization using surface deep hypothermia. A 
Mustard operation, including enlargement of the new left atrium with PTFE
(Goretex), was performed during total circulatory arrest. At the end, a permanent
pacemaker was positioned in the abdomen and epicardial wires were left on the
right ventricle. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient is doing
well 3 months latter. The interest of the case is that even in a complex
congenital cardiac malformation with complete a-v block, the technique of surface
deep hypothermia can be used because all the physiological parameters remain
stable during the procedure in spite of the very low heart rate.

Congenital polycystic tumor of the atrioventricular node: possible familial
occurrence and critical review of reported cases with special emphasis on
histogenesis.

Travers H.

Congenital polycystic tumor of the atrioventricular node is a rare tumor of
disputed histogenesis. It constant location in the atrioventricular node
separates it from other cardiac cysts and tumors of indisputable endodermal
origin. New studies of the embryogenesis of conduction tissues provide a
reasonable explanation for the site of the lesion. Morphologic and histochemical 
features of the tumor fail to conclusively favor either a mesothelial or an
endodermal genesis. A recently studied case provides some new morphologic
observations (complex desmosomes, granule-containing epithelial cells) and
suggests the possibility of of familial occurrence.

Pacemaker implantation in a neonate with congenital complete heart block--a case 
report.

Koga Y, Tomita M, Shibata K, Onitsuka T.

Reported herein is our experience with pacemaker implantation in a neonate with
complete AV block and without other concomitant cardiac anomalies. A male fetus
exhibited an intrauterine heart block rate of about 40 beats per minute on the
electrocardiogram. An emergency pacemaker implantation was attempted at birth by 
means of intravenous temporary pacing to relieve signs of congestive heart
failure. On the 28th day of life, a myocardial electrode was fixed on the right
ventricular wall and the generator was positioned on the left side of the
subcutaneous abdominal wall. A technical device was designed by means of packing 
pacemaker wire in a loop-forming fashion with a silastic sheet and was made in
such a way as to adjust with growth of the patient. During the 2 year follow-up
period, this technique proved to be effective. Our experience also supports the
contention that pacemaker implantation in the newborn is feasible and beneficial 
in the treatment of congenital complete AV block.

the unit should be prevented as the abdomen and breasts increase in size. The
problem of a fixed heart rate during the period of an increasing work load on the
heart in pregnancy is discussed, and the use in these patients of an
adjustable-rate pulse-generators is suggested.

[Atrioventricular block disclosing an isolated congenital aneurysm of the sinus
of Valsalva, extending into the septum and not ruptured].

[Article in French]

Sebag C, Davy JM, Scheublé C, Bouchareine F, Dussarat G, Aigueperse J, Motté G.

A case of a congenital aneurysm of the right anterior sinus of Valsalva (ASV)
extending into the septum is reported. The patient, a 20 year old male
Central-African, presented with syncopal complete atrioventricular block (AVB) or
recent onset. There were no clinical or radiological signs of associated cardiac 
disease. After implantation of a pacemaker, the diagnosis of an ASV extending
into the septum was suggested on routine M mode echocardiography. It was
confirmed by two-dimensional echocardiography and aortography. These
investigations provided data on its size, its relationship to the cardiac
chambers and also showed absence of rupture. The neck of the aneurysm was closed 
by an endo-aortic approach. There was moderate postoperative aortic
regurgitation. This case underlines the value of systematic echocardiography in
young patients with AVB of recent onset and obscure origin.

Congenital absence of superior vena cava: unusual anomaly of superior systemic
veins complicating pacemaker placement.

Hussain SA, Chakravarty S, Chaikhouni A, Smith JR.

Congenital anomalies of the superior systemic veins can complicate placement of
transvenous pacemaker electrode leads. Persistent left superior vena cava is the 
most common congenital anomaly; in this paper, we describe the case of a patient 
who had congenital absence of both superior venae cavae, which has not been
reported previously. The superior systemic veins drained into persistent double
azygos veins subdiaphragmatically. The anomaly was verified by venography.
Temporary cardiac pacing was established by passing the electrode lead through
the femoral vein, and a permanent epicardial pacemaker lead was placed
thereafter. This appears to be the first recorded case of such an anomaly.

Heterotopic epithelial replacement (so-called "mesothelioma") of the
atrioventricular node, congenital heart block, and sudden death.

Lie JT, Lufschanowski R, Erickson EE.

Heterotopic epithelial replacement (so-called "mesothelioma") of the
atrioventricular node is a rare cause of congenital heart block and sudden death;
only about 50 cases have been reported in the literature in predominantly female 
patients ranging in age from infancy to 86 years. The lesion is virtually
impossible to diagnose clinically and can be recognized at postmortem only by
histologic examination of the atrioventricular conduction tissue. A unique case
is reported since the patient, a young, asymptomatic woman, was chosen by chance 
as the subject of an electrophysiologic study of bradycardia 6 years before her
sudden death. The morphologic (light- and electron-microscopic) findings of the
atrioventricular node studied at autopsy were supportive of heterotopic
epithelial origin of the lesion. The disputed histogenesis is briefly discussed.

Maternal and neonatal implications of congenital complete heart block in the
fetus.

Reid RL, Pancham SR, Kean WF, Ford PM.

The detection of congenital complete heart block (CCHB) in a fetus should alert
the obstetrician that the welfare of both the mother and the newborn infant may
be in jeopardy. An awareness of this uncommon cause of fetal bradycardia and
judicious intrapartum monitoring can avert hasty and unnecessary cesarean section
for suspected fetal asphyxia. Neonatal consequences may range from no effect to
life-threatening congestive heart failure. The apparently healthy mothers of
these infants may be at increased risk for the subsequent development of collagen
vascular disease. Three recent case reports demonstrate the spectrum of neonatal 
and maternal disease that may accompany CCHB. The significance of abnormal
serology suggesting a propensity for collagen vascular disease in an otherwise
healthy parturient is discussed, and a program for follow-up is proposed.

Congenital complete heart block and long Q-T syndrome requiring ventricular
pacing for control of refractory ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.

Gascho JA, Schieken R.

A three-year-old girl with congenital complete heart block presented with
repeated bouts of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. The ECG
was remarkable for both complete heart block and a long Q-T interval, when
corrected for rate. The Q-T interval was longer than the Q-T interval of children
with congenital complete heart block and of children without heart disease.
Overdrive ventricular pacing was necessary to control the arrhythmias. A
prolonged Q-T interval in patients with complete heart block, even in the
presence of a normal QRS duration, may predispose the patient to sudden death.
Permanent pacing can suppress these arrhythmias by overdriving.

atrioventricular (AV) nodal pathways with recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia, committed suicide. Autopsy revealed an abnormally formed atrial
septum with insertion of eustachian valve on the AV part of the pars membranacea.
The intercuspid portion of the pars membranacea was muscular. The AV node was
located adjacent to the membranous part of the ventricular septum rather than the
central fibrous body. In addition, there was an accessory anterior AV node on the
parietal wall of the right atrium. Case 2, a 13-year-old boy with history of
recurrent ventricular tachycardia, died suddenly. CS revealed a right-sided,
markedly septated bundle. The first part of right bundle branch was divided into 
three parts, which later joined together. Both cases showed fatty infiltration of
the atrial septum, more than normal for the age of the patients. The relationship
of the recurrent tachyarrhythmias to the congenital abnormalities in the CS in
the two cases and the fatty infiltration is reviewed.

Antenatal detection of fetal A-V dissociation utilizing real-time B-mode
ultrasound.

Platt LD, Manning FA, Gray C, Guttenburg M, Turkel SB.

Congenital heart block is an unusual cause of fetal bradycardia. Until recently, 
the diagnosis could be confirmed only by evaluation of the fetal cardiac
electrical activity. Two cases are reported in which the diagnosis of
atrio-ventricular (A-V) dissociation was confirmed in the antepartum period by
real-time ultrasound evaluation of cardiac mechanical activity.

Gas pocket causing pacemaker malfunction.

Lasala AF, Fieldman A, Diana DJ, Humphrey CB.

Pacemaker malfunction was attributed to the increase in impedance to current flow
caused by a pocket of air separating the anodal contact plate of a unipolar
generator from the overlying skin. Lack of capture was noted 20 hours after
implantation. The malfunction was permanently corrected by bedside aspiration of 
the gas with a sterile syringe.

Congenitally complete heart block with an interrupted Mönckeberg sling.

Wenink AC.

The conducting tissues are described in a case of congenitally corrected
transposition. The patient was known to have suffered from congenital complete
atrioventricular block. In the heart, both anterior and posterior nodes and
bundles were found to coexist. The two bundles shared a common bifurcation.
Neither of the two nodes connected with their respective bundles. The different
morphology of the two sites of fibrous interruption may be explained by
differences in embryonic development.

Congenital complete heart block in the newborn associated with maternal systemic 
lupus erythematosus and other connective tissue disorders.

Hardy JD, Solomon S, Banwell GS, Beach R, Wright V, Howard FM.

Four babies with complete heart block associated with maternal systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) are described, together with a 5th baby whose mother had
serological abnormalities only. One baby had a rapidly fatal outcome, one has
required digoxin for heart failure, and the remaining 3 are asymptomatic but
remain in complete heart block. Additional manifestations were present in 2 of
them. The spectrum of neonatal abnormalities that may occur in association with
maternal SLE and related connective tissue disorders is discussed, together with 
the possible causes and the prognosis. We conclude that congenital heart block is
more common than had previously been appreciated.

The authors, having studied a case of Meadows syndrome, confirm that this
cardiomyopathy is a specific entity in pregnancy and the puerperium. They point
out the difficulties in diagnosis, as Meadows syndrome seems to be diagnosis of
elimination. They point out that a paraclinical balance has to be drawn up very
fully on the biological and haemodynamic planes to confirm this condition.
Finally, after a short discussion about the therapy, they tackle the problem of
the prognosis for life and for future childbearing in these patients, which is
determined by the persistence or absence of cardiac enlargement.

intrauterine hypoxia or fetal arrhythmia. The infant was found to have a single
ventricle, single atrium, a hypoplastic aortic arch and a coartation of the
aorta. The infant died neonatally.--The case was reported to emphasize the
necessity of fetal electrocardiography in continual antenatal monitoring to rule

The syndromes of familial atrioventricular block with sinus bradycardia:
prognostic indices, electrophysiologic and histopathologic correlates.

Schneider MD, Roller DH, Morganroth J, Josephson ME.

A family with adult onset heart block (AOHB) and sinus bradycardia (SB) was
investigated 5 yr after previous study. A 44-yr-old female previously 'normal'
presented ECG evidence of 1st-degree and 2nd-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) 
with normal intraventricular conduction and episodic 3rd-degree AVB. His bundle
electrocardiography (HBE) demonstrated A--H prolongation (245msec) with normal
H--V time during sinus rhythm and 3rd-degree AV nodal block with a His bundle
escape rhythm. Sinus node function served in first-order relatives. HBE and sinus
node function were normal in a 38-yr-old sister with new SB. 37 families with
familial 3rd-degree AVB were reviewed with attention to prognostic indices and
electrophysiologic-pathologic correlates. The incidence of conduction
abnormalities supported an autosomal dominant transmission with variable
penetrance. Subsidiary pacemaker rate and QRS morphology showed no discriminative
value with respect to prognosis. HBS identified A--H prolongation in 2 patients
with AOHB and 2 with AOHB and SB, with coexistent H--V conduction delay in 2
cases of AOHB and SB with abnormal QRS morphology. Histopathology was variable,
but the finding of multiple lesions in 2 of 5 patients with congenital heart
block and each of 2 with AOHB and SB suggests that mixed conduction system
disease is prevalent in familial heart block.

Lack of connection between the atria and the peripheral conduction system in a
case of corrected transposition with congenital atrioventricular block.

Bharati S, McCue CM, Tingelstad JB, Mantakas M, Shiel F, Lev M.

This is the first documented histologic study of the heart of a patient with
corrected transposition of the great vessels and congenital atrioventricular
(A-V) block with no connection between the atria and an anterior type of
peripheral conduction system. Musculature in the superior (anterior) walls of
both atria was absent, as was the anterior A-V node. The peripheral conduction
system began with the bundle of His. In place of the absent atrial musculature,
fibrosis and calcification were present. The relation of laboratory evidence of
connective tissue dyscrasia in the mother to the congenital A-V block in the
child is discussed.

Successful intracardiac repair of the Taussig-Bing malformation in 2 children.

Snoddy JW, Parr EL, Robertson LW, Mauck HP, McCue CM, Lower RR.

Surgical repair of the Taussig-Bing deformity has been successful in 2 children
weighting 7.7 and 11.1 kg, respectively. In the first case the right ventricular 
patch divered left ventricular blood to the pulmonary arter, thus creating a
physiologically complete transposition which was then corrected by an interatrial
Mustard baffle. In the second case a right ventricular tunnel diverted left
ventricular blood to the aorta, and right ventricular blood was directed to the
distal pulmonary artery by means of an external conduit bypassing a subpulmonic
stenosis. These patients represent the seventh and eighth successful corrections 
of the Taussig-Bing anomaly. One case (Patient 2) is the youngest to undergo
repair and the first to receive an external conduit for bypass of an associated
subpulmonic stenosis.

Fourteen years of implanted pacemakers in children.

Shearin RP, Fleming WH.

Twenty-six children who had permanent pacemakers implanted at 6 hours to 11 years
of age have been followed for up to 163 months. There were 14 children with
surgical heart block, 9 with congenital heart block, 2 with postcatheterization
complete heart block, and 1 with bradytachydysrhythmia syndrome. Eighteen of the 
26 patients (69%) are still being paced with their original electrodes, some for 
more than eight years. Sixty pulse generators lasted an average of 17 months
(range, 1 to 55 months). Five of the 26 patients (19%) are dead. Three died of
noncorrectable heart disease, but there were 2 sudden unexplained deaths at home,
both apparently due to sudden arrhtthmias. Both of these patients had received
fixed-rate pulse generators, and 1 had a known potential for competing rhythms.
The current optimal choices of equipment and techniques, including the role of
synchronized, demand, lithium-powered, and nuclear-powered pulse generators, are 
discussed.

Persistent atrial standstill with limb girdle muscular dystrophy.

Antônio JH, Diniz MC, Miranda D.

A case of persistent atrial standstill associated with muscular dystrophy of the 
limb girdle type is reported for the first time in the literature, In spite, of
advanced myopathy, the patient delivered an apparently normal child. Hemodynamic 
studies including a normal coronary cinearteriography were performed in the
post-partum period. The patient also had clinical and radiological evidence of
peptic ulcer which may be the expression of an excessive vagal tone. A
congenitial anomaly of the conduction system might explain the association of
left anterior hemiblock with persistent atrial standstill, but could not be
demonstrated.

Familial congenital complete heart block and maternal systemic lupus

Winkler RB, Nora AH, Nora JJ.

A family is reported in which two siblings had congenital complete heart block
with resultant congestive heart failure, the father and paternal grandfather show
adult-onset conduction defects, and the mother has systemic lupus erythematosis. 
The interaction of heredity and environment is discussed in this context. A
review of the literature on familial complete heart block suggests that so-called
pure congenital-onset familial heart block, originally felt to be genetic, may in
fact have an important enivronmental component, specifically related to ongoing
maternal factors such as systemic lupus erythematosis.

Heart block, sudden death, and atrioventricular node mesothelioma.

Ross MJ.

We report a case of mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node with congenital
complete heart block and sudden death in a 15-year-old girl. This benign tumor
probably represents a hamartoma derived from mesothelium with a constant anatomic
location and uniform association with heart block. The clinical course of such
patients, however, has been variable. The tumor has been associated with sudden, 
unexpected death in infancy or adolescence, but has more often been discovered as
an incidental finding at autopsy in a middle-aged or elderly patient.

A new prenatal cardiac diagnostic device for congenital heart disease.

Hamilton LA Jr, Fisher E, Horn C, DuBrow I, Vidyasagar D.

A unique case of congenital heart disease and complete heart block diagnosed by
fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) and phonocardiogram recorded initially at 32 weeks 
gestation is presented. The slow, regular fetal heart rate of approximately 50
beats/min with bizarre QRS and a diamond-shaped murmur beginning with the fetal
QRS complex made a diagnosis of complete heart block (CHB) and associated
congenital heart disease highly probable. Direct fetal electrocardiograms (FECG) 
recorded during labor and vaginal delivery at term confirmed the diagnosis of
completel atrioventricular block. Cardiac catheterization at 1 day of age showed 
multiple congenital heart anomalies. The infant developed signs of congestive
heart failure and transvenous pacemaker was successfully placed; however, he died
at 9 days of age of sepsis and renal failure.

De subitaneis mortibus. XXVI. Fatal electrical instabiltiy of the heart
associated with benign congenital polycystic tumor of the atrioventricular node.

James TN, Galakhov I.

Benign congenital polycystic tumors of the atrioventricular (A-V) node are an
unusual but not very rare cause of heart block. Two such cases are presented and 
discussed in conjunction with the reported experience of other. The tumor is
always within and only very near the A-V node, seldom involves more than the
proximal end of the His bundle, and has not been reported to occur in the sinus
node. Although sudden death has been reported in conjunction with these tumors, a
surprising number of other patients have lived to old age and died of causes
unrelated to the A-V nodal tumor. As a corollary it is important to consider a
diagnosis of A-V nodal tumor in any patient of any age who presents with
otherwise unexplained heart block or syncope. From accumulated experience it
appears that such patients do not tolerate electronic pacing safely and some
possible explanations for this are discussed. Escape rhythm in all reported cases
has been characterized by QRS complexes which are narrow and a ventricular rate
which is from half to two-thirds of the sinus rate. Reasons why an A-V junctional
rhythm which is 66% of sinus rate may be especially stable are discussed.

In a pregnant woman of 20 years is recorded a foetal bradycardia of 60 beats per

cardiological examination shows a congenital complete heart block. After
spontaneous delivery of a male infant at date the heart block persists for more
than 7 months. There are are no malformations; a interdependence with
influenza-infection of the mother is not to be proved. The diagnosis of the
congenital heart block is rare. Of 40 cases pointed out in the literature only 3 
cases has been diagnosed before the 35. week of pregnancy.

Congenital sinus bradycardia combined with congenital total atrioventricular
block.

Stopfkuchen H, Jüngst BK.

Sinus bradycardia and total atrioventricular block were found at the age of seven
months in a boy who is now 16 1/2 years old. According to Yaters (1929) criteria,
these are likely to be congenital disorders. While the frequency of the
ventricular impulse generator in the upper bundle of His only slowed in
accordance with age during the period of observation, the sinus node activity
deteriorated considerably. Finally potentials could only be sporadically
demonstrated. Under heavy stress and with a simultaneous slight increase in
ventricular frequency, a re-occurence of regular but slow sinus node activity
came about. The cause of this binodal disorder of rhythm is unknown. There is no 
indication of family affliction or of myocarditis in early childhood. Congenital 
heart disease could also be excluded.

Congenitally complete heart block. Developmental aspects.

Anderson RH, Wenick AC, Losekoot TG, Becker AE.

Three cases of congenitally complete heart block are described of hearts in which
other minor congenital malformations were not in themselves severe enough to
disrupt the atrioventricular conduction system. The cases fitted well into the
categorization of complete heart block suggested by Lev. Two exhibited lack of
communication between the atrial and conducting tissues, the other had
discontinuity of the penetrating atrioventricular bundle. In an attempt to
explain why this discontinuity between different segments of the conducting
tissues occurs, we re-examined several series of graded human embryos. This
investigation suggested that the anulus fibrosus in the normal heart is derived
from sulcus tissue of the atrioventricular junction, the endocardial
atrioventricular cushions playing a minor role in the separation of atria from
ventricles. The relationships between the sulcus tissues and the different
components of the atrioventricular junctional area are discussed in terms of an
explanation both for the existence of different types of congenitally complete
heart block and for persistence of Mahaim (nodo-ventricular and nodo-fascicular) 
fibers.

[Intraventricular conduction delays, ventricular pre-excitation and ventricular

[Article in Italian]

Pellegrino L.

An examination is made on different members of a family in which, owing to
hereditary transmission of dominant autosomal type, exist alterations that
sometimes manifest with disorders of the intraventricular conduction, sometimes
with more or less pronounced aspects of ventricular pre-excitation and some other
time with anomalies of the ventricular repolarization phase. In examining the
genealogical tree of the family, there are in the fourth generation five cases of
short PQ-normal QRS syndrome and one case with ventricular repolarization
anomalies; in the third generation six cases with left anterior hemiblock, one
case with short PQ-normal QRS syndrome, one case with Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome and three cases with ventricular repolarization anomalies; in the second
generation three cases with bundle branch block associated with left anterior
hemiblock. The clinical laboratory investigation permitted to exclude the
presence of congenital or acquired heart diseases which, rather frequently are
responsible for documented electrocardiographic anomalies; the morphology and
cardiac volumetry, put in evidence by radiological examinations, remained within 
the limits of the normal.

This report presents a ten-year old child suffering from sick sinus syndrome, in 
the "Bradycardia-tac hycardia-asystole" variant. A long observation and an ECG
made when he was 7 have never shown a sinusal rhythm. An involvement of the A-V
node is also present, made clear by a block of the second degree with not very
high atrial rates and by prolonged refractory periods, as well as an involvement 
of the intraventricular conduction, made evident by an incomplete right bundle
branch block and by a long refractory period of the anterior fascicle. The
clinical, laboratory and hemodynamic data excluded either a congenital or an
acquired cardiopathy. The ECGs of the patient's relatives excluded a familiar
type of S.S.S. It is, therefore, an idiopathic S.S.S., which is very rare in
children. The nosological set in the still vague field of the idiopathic
degenerations of the conduction tissue is discussed.

Late development of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction after repair of
double-outlet right ventricle.

A 22-year-old woman had exertional chest pain and dyspnea secondary to left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction more than a decade after repair of a type I
double-outlet right ventricle. The obstruction was the result of (1) failure of
the ventricular septal defect and the tunnel created between the left ventricle
and aorta to enlarge commensurate with growth of the heart and (2) a markedly
hypertrophied parietal band of the crista supraventricularis which surrounded and
narrowed the aortic orifice. At reoperation, the ventricular septal defect and
the tunnel were enlarged and the hypertrophied crista supraventricularis was
partially resected. The patient is asymptomatic 6 months after operation.

During a routine physical examination, a 34-year-old man, in apparent good
health, had an electrocardiogram which revealed left axis deviation. Cardiac
evaluation disclosed mild aortic regurgitation and left anterior fascicular
block. Nine months later, the patient was admitted to the critical care unit
after he had experienced cardiac arrest while jogging. Angiograms demonstrated a 
large unruptured aneurysm in the right coronary sinus of Valsalva protuding into 
the left ventricle. Echocardiographic manifestations also suggested also
suggested a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The defect was repaired through an aortic
approach. The aneurysmal sac was emptied and the neck sutured securely.
Twenty-two months postoperatively, the patient continues to be asymptomatic. We
anticipate that this will decrease the threat of recurrent arrhythmias..

The return of A-V conduction is described in a patient after two decades of
high-grade or complete congenital heart block. Similar cases have been reported
by others, with remission or even recovery commencing up to the fourth decade or 
later. A similar phenomenon is also described in four patients with acquired
heart block of four to ten years' duration; in them, remission was usuallly brief
but persisted for seven years in one patient. No full report of this seems to
have been published previously. Possible explanations are discussed, but no
conclusion is reached. Apart from its interest, the phenomenon is of importance
with respect to the selection of demand-type electronic pacemakers in the
management of patients with heart block.

The authors present a clinico-pathological study of three cases of complete

familial, and the heart was macroscopically normal. In the other two cases, the
associated abnormalities (complete discontinuity of the aortic arch in one, and
situs inversus with a patent ductus and high VSD in the other) were not
responsible for the conductive defect. This was explained after study of serial
sections of the inter-atrio-ventricular septum; these showed an interuption or
absence of the penetrating portion of the bundle of His associated, in one case, 
with agenesis of the atrio-ventricular node.
